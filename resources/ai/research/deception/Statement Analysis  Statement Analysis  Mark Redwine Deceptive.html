<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif;"><b>For those new here, there are many articles which explain the process to which statements are subjected for analysis. &nbsp;In this case, we will focus upon a few principles.&nbsp;</b></span><br>

I know his FRIENDS were important to him so we were wanting to make sure he had adequate time with his FRIENDS. Um, you know basically the plan was Monday and Tuesday he would spend with his FRIENDS. Maybe Wednesday, you know we had talked a little bit about going bowling or doing something as an activity, not with just me and him, his FRIENDS included.<br><br>Peter you mentioned the sensitivity with his use of the word FRIENDS,could it be that his father was jealous of the time Dylan spent with?

What did those "friends" say about the father-son relationship?<br><br>This guy needs to hook up with billie jean dunn.  He sounds just like her.  <br><br>Poor Dylan.  Yet another child a victim of his parents problems.

<p>
Has Mark Redwine ever named Dylan's friends?<br><br>Are there any phone records of Dylan's friends calling him while he was with his father or vice-versa?<br><br>This case sounds like a man who wants to punish his ex-wife by taking away her most loved "possession."<br><br>He disparages his missing son by implying that Mark was lazy and defiant.  <br><br>"You can't make him...etc."<br><br>

Hey!  Sorry for posting this as an off-topic comment, but I couldn't find a more direct way to try and send these links.  Here's a story local to me I'd love you insights on -- was the wife aware of her husband's involvement in the axe-murder of their family's two dogs?  (Unfortunately, I can't find more statements from the husband as well, beyond the single quote in the first interview)<br><br>Original link:<br>http://www.katu.com/news/local/Investigation-launched-after-two-dogs-found-killed-180192491.html?tab=video&amp;c=y<br><br>Follow-up story:<br>http://www.katu.com/news/local/Deputies-Man-killed-dogs-he-couldnt-afford-to-care-for-190459021.html<br><br>

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGEwCBPy90w<br><br>KUSA - Dylan Redwine - Dad's uncut interview<br><br>Published on Feb 5, 2013<br>13-year-old Dylan Redwine vanished from southwestern Colorado on November 19th. His disappearance remains a mystery. This is the uncut interview with his dad, Mark Redwine. Please excuse the zooms, pauses, and sidetracks. We didn't videotape this with the intention of showing the whole thing; however, there has been so much interest in this case, we decided to put it on YouTube.

This is from KUSA interview - <br>http://youtu.be/fGEwCBPy90w<br><br>MR asked after the movie (MR) introduces, Dy watched a movie, they bought at Walmart. Reporter what was Dylan doing?, she asking him of Sunday late night? asking him, what happened? <br><br>@14:28 of the YT  <br><br>Mark Redwine: the movie, being finished, at some point, I was pacing the floor, and got up,  and was taking care of a few little things, you know, over here at the Kitchen table, while we were doing that,,but you know, it's shortly after the ending of that movie which my guess, and I don't recall, because I don't keep track of the Clock, you know, and it must of been,,, I thought it was earlier in the beginning because I was fairly tired anyway and I know Dylan was tired because he had indicated to me, that he had been up to till 4oclock the night before, and that he had spent most of the day at the airport, traveling to get here.. that he was tired, and you know it's seems to me, that it had to be around 10:30'ish maybe by the time the movie got done, somewhere in there,,,  <br><br>And you know shortly after that, I ran up and went to bed, and he finished up doing, whatever he was doing, watching Nickelodeon, or whatever he was watching ....and you know<br><br>* Time jump* now it is Mark's morning. Not Dylan's but his own. <br><br>I get up to go run my errands cos <br>I had a payroll issue that needed to be dealt with first thing Monday morning,,,<br><br>Cos that's when payroll goes in, and so it was important for me to get down there, as early as possible, well I wanted to leave at 6:30 so I would be there at 7:30 when they opened the doors, you know, I spent 45mins  an hour trying to get Dylan to waaake up.. helping him, saying you know Dylan,  I am going down, cos he had talked to me about seeing his friend Ryan that morning ....<br>--<br>Where is Dylan in his " story"? The TV is less than 10 feet from the kitchen table, as he says he was pacing. The couch even closer to the table. "Pacing" He doesn't answer the question, what happened after the movie. He says a lot yet does not answer the question of what happened, Dylan being the subject. His sensitive is not sharing to her the " time" of when the evening shared ended, the movie is meaningless.  <br><br>What is of this entire interview is Mark Redwine does not commit to any time actual. It's noticed boldly that he will not offer a time relative to Dylan. He uses " Ish" "then or there" "I don't recall". However in the AM his doings, his personal, he is very explicit and firm on the actual Time.

Comparing the times said by Mark Redwine in this KUSA interview to the timeline provided by LE. <br><br>LE: DY arrived Airport: 5:46pm<br>MR: DY Arrived Airport: 6:00pm, maybe 6:20pm, I don't know<br><br>LE: DY captured on Walmart Camera - 7:05pm<br><br>MR: Walmart - No time said, was immediate from Airport to Walmart. He said we went immediately to Walmart from the Airport -<br><br>LE: McDonald's he went to at 7:22pm<br>MR: McDonald's - we left at 7:30 ish around there<br><br>LE: DY Last Text 9:37 PM<br><br>MR: Texting " sketchy" he was texting, no service until after the dam, did not say Dy was in his truck texting, he spaces, places DY on his couch, when asked about DY texing on his phone. He was texting, or playing video games,  watching the movie, I don't know what he was doing, I assumed he was texting...  <br><br>The living area and the kitchen of Mark Redwine's home is very small, and the rooms are conjoined. How he could not see what, when, is bothersome, as Dylan allegedly spent his majority of the evening in the living area. You can see in the video, Marks stove is near the front door. This how small of an area. The living room furniture feet away from his kitchen table. <br><br>Timeline provided by LE <br>http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22442955/sheriff-releases-details-dylan-redwines-last-known-activities#ixzz2KMvQTcPt

Not Dylan's but his own. <br><br>I get up to go run my errands COS <br>I had a payroll issue that needed to be dealt with first thing Monday morning,,,<br><br>COS that's when payroll goes in, and so it was important for me to get down there, as early as possible, well I wanted to leave at 6:30 so I would be there at 7:30 when they opened the doors, you know, I spent 45mins an hour trying to get Dylan to waaake up.. helping him, saying you know Dylan, I am going down, COS he had talked to me about seeing his friend Ryan that morning ....<br>--<br><br>Wow,<br>Peter says when there is a need to explain and not report what happened it becomes highly sensitive. <br><br>He says "BECAUSE" 3 times,and "COS" 3 times which is also a need to explain.

His said of the clock <br><br>but you know, it's shortly after the ending of that movie which my guess, and I don't recall, because I don't keep track of the Clock, you know, and it must of been,,, I thought it was earlier in the beginning <br><br>I wrote his said out verbatim, he does say it as it is written. <br><br>" I don't keep track of the clock" <br><br>Not he wasn't paying attention to the time. He states " I do not keep track of the clock". <br><br>He is a Truck Driver, Long Distance Trucker. Time is everything. It's all based upon timing, pick up and delivery. Being on time, Just in Time, if Time it is not committed to, you sir do not get paid, run or no run. <br><br>He will not commit to a time, in any question asked of him relative to Dylan. Not once does he willing offer a time as in, it was *pm or *am of Dylan.  No, he adds ish, around there, maybe it was, or I don't know. For his morning, his leaving, his payroll he offers a definitive firm time, yes he does. <br>The morning, Monday, is not sensitive to him. <br><br>Sunday is, the day before, this when Dylan arrived. His son he fought for, hired an attorney to gain this visitation. Dylan was sent to him. Every event was that unremarkable for him? he not able to once offer a time that Dylan was in his presence.

Thank you Peter. This is a great analysis.<br><br>I have a question about phone calls. Mark Redwine said he made a phone call in the morning to a property manager. Isn't mentioning that some sort of indicator? A good percent of murderers mention phone calls?

R: Do you have anything directly to say to Dylan?<br><br>M: Dylan, my prayers are with you and I love you very much. He was the light of my life and he meant everything to me.<br><br>Peter, I noticed you underlined "was" as past tense but you didn't underline "meant" also.    Is there a reason that I'm missing?   For sure meant is past tense when I read it.<br><br>That's twice in one sentence that the dad references Dylan in past tense.

Mark Redwine: the movie, being finished, at some point, I was pacing the floor, and got up, and was taking care of a few little things, you know, over here at the Kitchen table, while we were doing that,,<br><br><br>This is out of order.   How do you pace the floor and THEN get up?   So where did the dad get up from in order to take care of a few little things??    What is over here at the kitchen table while "we" were doing that....  What is that?<br><br>That whole paragraph doesn't make sense.

He was texting, or playing video games, watching the movie, I don't know what he was doing, I assumed he was texting... <br><br>Texting can be done by anyone without detection of who is sending the text.  Could Mark have sent these final text and caught himself when he said Dylan was texting but then decided that maybe he should not have known if he sent a text at that time or not. He makes the statement and then quickly backs away from it.<br><br>He also makes a point to tell us that Dylan had not been in his bedroom at all. But after his pacing, he ran to the bedroom to go to bed.  Or did he run to the bedroom to collect Dylan's things, to find the backpack that he didn't locate immediately.<br><br>Mark Redwine: the movie, <b>being finished, at some point</b>, I was PACING the floor, and got up, and was taking care of a few little things, you know, over here at the Kitchen table, <b>while we were doing that</b>,,but you know, it's <b>shortly after the ending of that movie</b> which my guess, and I don't recall, BECAUSE I don't keep track of the Clock, you know, and it must of been,,, I thought <b>it was earlier in the beginning</b> BECAUSE I was fairly tired anyway and I know Dylan was tired BECAUSE he had indicated to me, that he had been up to till 4oclock the night before, and that he had spent most of the day at the airport, traveling to get here.. that he was tired, and you know it's seems to me, that it had to be around 10:30'ish maybe by <b>the time the movie got done</b>, somewhere in there,,, <br><br>He talks about the end of the movie but then goes back to the beggining of the movie and distances himself from Dylan at that point in time - he was in the kitchen, Dylan in the living room.  I am completely speculating but get the feeling this is when Dylan died - early into the movie but the movie continued to play in the background while Mark paced and decided what to do next. I think Mark used Dylan's cell phone to send out a few additional text and may have disposed of Dylan's body and then returned to realize Dylan's backpack (not found immediately) was still at his house.  If Mark was to say Dylan left on his own, he would need the backpack to be gone also.

And what would being tired have to do with when the movie ended?  Almost sounds like he is convincing himself that they were both tired and that is why tempers may have escalated into a fight.

Poor Dylan! This is heartbreaking! He has obvious injuries and  a unhappy demeanor in the photos taken minutes after being with Mark Redwine!

M: Dylan, my prayers are with you and I love you very much. He was the light of my life and he meant everything to me.<br><br>My prayers are "with" you.  I would consider my prayers going up to God in heaven and to be "with" someone, they would need to be there also.  I would expect him to say "I am praying for you"

Officials revealed Thursday that Dylan arrived at Durango-La Plata airport at 5:46 p.m. Nov. 18; at 7:05 p.m., he was seen at a Durango Walmart; at 7:22 p.m., he went to a Durango McDonald's; and his <b>last text message was sent at 9:37 p.m.</b> on Nov. 18. They hope the information will yield new information. <br><br>Last text message, an hour before the end of the movie and Mark claims Dylan was still awake when he went to bed.  Does anyone know what this last text message was?

I thought Dylan's scent wasn't available for the sniffer dogs. it makes me wonder if Dylan made it to Mark Redwines house. The most direct route from the Durango MacDonalds doesn't go through Bayfield. I wonder if they stopped at the reservoir dam to eat..

If Dylan is where the scent dogs and FBI were looking in the reservoir, the waters in the reservoir mix in March, the USGS documented a spring-turn-over, they might look again.

 Jen said...<br>Finally got all the way through the video...the fathers language is VERY concerning and full of red flags. This may take a few posts!<br><br>First an observation based on a lifetime of experience with relatives suffering from the same affliction...Mark Redwine appears to be an alcoholic. His language, appearance and behavior are all factors in my opinion. He makes reference to the fact that he's a private person, and tries to explain his lack of social interaction by his dedication to his son (although his son has lived several states away for some time). Also court documents found online detail a drunken incident where he claims to have been 'beaten' by his older son and left unconscious for HOURS..which paints a picture of what life with him was really like...a belligerent drunk, who became violent to the point where the kids had to fight back.<br><br>His resentment toward his ex-wife is seething, and preoccupies him even as he speaks of his 'main focus', Dylan. He brings up (unprompted) the fact that Elaine does not want him to know where she works, and taunts that not only does he know, but he also shares it with the public. He declares that he didn't 'pester' Dylan for details about his life with his mom, but reveals how important the topic actually is by bringing up his knowledge of her 'secret' workplace..leaving the interviewer unsure how to respond. (its likely Elaine tried to keep her workplace secret to prevent him from showing up there drunk and causing a scene, or otherwise sabotaging her employment)<br><br>Overall he attempts to portray himself as a victim, like he was just floating along being father-of-the-year and the ONLY reason he can't be is his ex-wife.(this is common thinking in alcoholics, they always see themselves as a victim). According to him, he concentrated all of his love, attention, blah, blah...and his mother-she just worked. He claims he didn't 'pester' Dylan, if he didn't call him back (explaining lack of consistent contact and close relationship). Says he wanted to go to a 'sit down' restaurant and talk, but Dylan wanted to get drive thru and eat as they drove (everything points to a poor relationship and Dylan just trying to get through the time he was forced to be there). Dad claims he and Dylan did get along, 'contrary to what others may believe', and says Dylan was a peacemaker who told his mom whatever she wanted to hear (acknowledging that Dylan probably spoke of their relationship in negative terms to his mom/others). All together its a grim prospect for Dylan...<br>February 9, 2013 at 2:27 PM<br>

Mark Redwine would have us believe that after fighting for visitation during the week of Thanksgiving (when most spend time with extended family) he had no plans for how he and Dylan would spend the week and only bought a few snacks at Walmart until they decided what they were going to do. <br><br>He mentions the inconvenience of traveling back into town when referring to trying to reach Dylan the morning he 'went missing' to see if he needed anything. This contradicts several elements of his story, including the shopping trip where he only buys a few things, the fact that he supposedly left Dylan sleeping when it would ensure another trip to town to take him to his friends, and claiming that after returning home to find Dylan gone, he took a nap(!?) then went to town in search of Dylan's friends to get an idea where he was. (rather than calling any of the friends, Dylan's mom, brother or anyone else who may have talked to him, he makes the inconvenient trip into town...he's alibi building, and doesn't want his ex to find out whats going on and call police before he's contacted a few people 'looking' for Dylan)<br><br>Mark Redwine says in contacting the 'marshal' about Dylan being missing he expected the officer would "BANG HIM IN THE HEAD and tell him your dad is trying to get ahold of you". (wow) He says Moms focus is blaming someone, and references 'beating up' 4x in reference to blaming himself or being blamed for what happened. He says he believes Dylan is kidnapped and asks the captor to have some compassion in their heart, but then says he wouldn't care if DYLAN reached out to him or his ex-wife for help. He talks about what items are or are not in Dylan's backpack (how does he know, according to his story they barely spent 5hrs together before going to sleep...when did he inventory his sons backpack?)<br>February 9, 2013 at 4:11 PM<br>

Most concerning to me a the repeated past tense references(too many to list) and when he says he 'prays' to Dylan..his language throughout shows knowledge that Dylan is dead, and his references to 'bang' him in the head, 'dump' him off somewhere, and his emotion upon each mention of the topic 'baseball' suggests he knows what happened to Dylan. Mark Redwine says he believes a kidnapper has Dylan but negates that idea by saying he would 'trade places with him in a heartbeat, IF it would bring him home' (the only way it wouldn't is if he's not alive). He also states that unlike his ex who wants to blame and point fingers, he just wants to let the investigation happen, which is too passive and doesn't show the passion a father should feel about the investigation into his sons disappearance.<br><br>Considering all the information known in this case, including the custody battle, ordered visitation and all of the things Peter and other posters have pointed out, I think the father is responsible for what happened to Dylan. I don't know whether it was a planned attack or a moment of rage where the father took out his anger toward the mother/situation on the only person he could gain access to. The father repeatedly references Dylan and baseball (each time holding back emotion), along with 'bang him in the head' and 'dump him off somewhere', so it's almost as if he's leaking out the story. Those are very strange references to make when talking about your 'missing' son and most people would tend to romanticize any thoughts about what is happening with their son, and how the situation will be resolved. <br><br>I think the father was/is resentful of the mother moving on with her life as well as Dylan and lashed out in the most devastating way he could (kind of like, you removed him from my life...now you get to see how it feels). If you remember the mothers first instinct was that the father 'removed him from the situation' and only she knows what her ex is capable of and how intense his anger surrounding the custody battle was at the time...she was forced by court order to send her son for a visit which says a lot. Sadly the fathers language appears to confirm what she knew from the beginning. Poor Dylan.<br>February 9, 2013 at 5:14 PM<br>

<br><br>OT: I was shopping online a few nights ago and noted: Dillard's has a "children's" department. Kohl's has a "kid's" department. I wondered: what's going on at Dillard's.

Jo, to add to the timeline that was released, Jan 2013 by LE. <br><br>You asked about the last text of Dylan. There is verbage about this on the reporters, she interviewed both parents, on her own Twitter. <br>https://twitter.com/MelissaBlasius<br><br>Was it a text at 9:37? or was it a ping? LE will not release what it is or was. " Electronic Record" is the actual said, of the 9:37 transmission. You can read the tweets on her page. <br><br>Elaine was interviewed by Ms. Blasius, and she @1:42 answers the last time she heard from Dy. <br>Last text she received from Dylan was at 7:06 pm. <br><br>The LE timeline, DY was captured on camera inside the Walmart at 7:05pm. He then texted Mom while inside the store. I am now listening to Elaine's interview. <br><br>This little guy has a Nation wanting him home, safe, it truly is heartbreaking. Where is Dylan? <br>This where S.A. does aid, I do believe that it helps LE. I know they read here, Law Enforcement. This is not picking apart a person, it is ironing out what was " Stated" - Statements. It's difficult to remove the emotions, as this is about Dylan, a lost missing and yes exploited 14 yr old. <br><br>Exploited by one, as it is my opinion, his own father. I had to say it, as his statements make my brain squirrel. <br><br>His own words come across as Dy was an irritation and wasn't wanted. The polar opposite of he hiring an atty and going the distance to gain him legally * for this visit. Not caring that Dylan willingly did not want to go. The result of this, this visitation granted is Dylan is Poof. :(

I don't think Dylan wanted to be there with a controlling, bitter old drunk. But since Dylan was forced to go to Bayfield- he tried to spend some time with his grade school friends.<br><br>Dad did not like this 'friend' plan of Dylan's , he became furious and hurt him. (banged in head)<br><br>Dad was pacing what to do now!! The movie plays on in the background. Dad realizes he is really close to a deserted (summer) lake- kids drown all the time- AHA!<br><br>Dad 'finishes up' some sort of weight at the kitchen table. He 'dumps' his poor son in the lake. In the morning he runs around 'doing errands' making alibis. <br><br>I don't think he necessarily planned to kill his son- he uses some personal regret/sadness in his language. But the silver lining to him is the 'payback' for ex and older son.<br><br>[Bayfield is relatively far from the lake- you would combine trips if possible. It was no longer possible...]<br>

Thank you Christy...I felt silly reposting but I really got into analyzing the video and I was surprised by a lot the dads answers...he didn't address finding Dylan or keeping people aware of him being missing until late in the interview and he only did so in response to the interviewers questions. If my son was missing every precious moment I had on-camera would be focused on finding him, and providing info to achieve that

Kaaryn Gough said...<br><br>    ...he was with me the night before. And you know, I saw him in the morning before I left to go run my errands.<br><br>    Change in language: he was with me applies only to the night before. But in the morning, he only saw him. The father no longer considered his son to be "with him" in the morning.<br><br>********<br><br>Thank you Kaaryn.    This reminds me of the Hailey Dunn case where her mother, Billie Jean, said she told Hailey goodnite at 10pm 12/26.  Then the early morning (6 am) of 12/27, Billie stated she saw Hailey in her bed with the tv on, but she didn't touch her, it was dark and she was pacified.

Mark Redwine/His statement on what Dylan told him, of cellular service inside his own house. <br><br>@13:20 Verbatim: The two places he told me he could get service, was from the corner of the couch where he was sitting, which has been changed, but right by the TV there, and my room. He didn't go in my room, he went upstairs for a few things, brought the DVD player down, so we could watch that movie he wanted to watch...<br><br>He asked what happened, after the movie, what was Dylan doing?<br>14:28 of the interview he begins his response, this a snip of his response: <br><br>"and you know it's seems to me, that it had to be around 10:30'ish maybe by the time the movie got done, somewhere in there, and you know shortly after that, I ran up and went to bed, and he finished up doing whatever he was doing, watching Nickelodeon, or whatever he was watching ....and<br>you know"... I get up to go run my errands cos I had a payroll issue that needed to be dealt with first thing Monday Morning, cos thats when payroll goes in, and so it was important for me to get down there as early as possible, well I wanted to leave at 6:30 so I would be there at 7:30 when they opened the doors..<br>---<br>Jo, you wrote,  "I think Mark used Dylan's cell phone to send out a few additional text"<br><br>I think Mark had Dylan's phone, yet he used it as a divining rod within his household. I do not believe, Dy told him the two places he could "get" service. It's not logical. His, Dylan went up stairs, he didn't go into my room. Quite possible DY did not go into his room, it's that he said, he didn't go into my room, that is the flag. DY went upstairs to retrieve the DVD player, is not an unexpected. <br><br>His phone did go into Dad's room, not by Dylan but by Dad. Note Dad does not say " bedroom" he says MY ROOM. We cannot perceive then it was a bedroom, as he does not say it. Dy's phone a older model flip phone, no GPS built in. He Dad went around the house seeing where the bar's peaked, connection activated? he wanting to know if the phone actually did ping within from his house to the nearest tower?<br><br>His, *I ran up* and went to bed, leaving Dy doing whatever he was doing is empty, an empty statement, there is no substance, no closing of the said statement.  <br>His said, ran up, his previous said, he was pacing, as Hobs pointed out, this sounds like anxiety. <br><br>Mark does not say I went to sleep, nor does he say anything of Dylan going to sleep. He does not say Dylan, he no longer is named, he is liquid and is labeled " HE" Dylan does not exist, there is no Dylan.  <br><br>He continues on, opens up a new time table within his next breath. He is in the next morning, this he is speaking of, is prior to 6:30AM Monday. Did he Mark ever sleep? His night does not end and his next words are, he wanted to leave at 6:30am. Therefore he was alert planning, prior to 6:30am, he wanted to LEAVE at 6:30am, not that he " awoke" at 6:30am. His stated is he wanted to leave.. who kept him from leaving? at 6:30 am? He kept his own self from leaving is who. The story of Dylan wasn't having it, is simply like a carburetor, being primed with gasoline, to fit why he wasn't able to leave as he had planned. <br>-- <br>I think he found himself back at his own house, bet 6:30 and 7:30am. He the one that didn't want to wake up, as he was in his own self created nightmare.

<p>
The lack of Aesthetics - Mark the Man. 8.5 yrs myself, being a skin care tech. People tell you things, or do not have to, it is of their skin, that speaks. I watched, I see him. He shows himself as he feels himself. A Hot MESS. He isn't of lacking of observable hygiene, but of one that doesn't have respect for himself let alone others he comes into contact with. His eyes from jump of Dylan's reported missing, I noticed, along with his skin tone. He is one that is years of absorbed alcohol, he is pickled. It's worn on his face, like a road map. People not only tell you who they are, learned by listening, they show us who they are by the skin that they self create, from the inside to the outside.<br><br>He a long haul truck driver by trade. How does his outward appearance affect him?  My bro is a LDH, 25 yrs, what you represent on the outside, on the road, is not only your being, but your character. Your Rig as well, it if is clean sharp and well kept, it shows your craft is your trade, you mean business. Your paper work proof, that is in order, intact, is organized. You earn respect and in return respect others for doing the same. Truckers keeping themselves up, keeping their Rig up with standards is work. Long haul trucking is not for everyone, it's very hard on the human body, this why I write what I write. Know a Trucker ask him/her. They will tell you their health and appearance matter. Unraveled by choice. This is what I see of him. He doesn't have to say it, it is what he has shown consistent of his own self. His statements. His micro-expressions. Watch him change within these mins of the interview: <br><br>Start the video of Mark at 10:00<br>http://youtu.be/fGEwCBPy90w<br><br>10:00 is where it becomes relative to Dylan and his time with him. She/reporter asks very few questions in this candid, extremely casual interview. She is not interrogating him. He has no audience, he is in his own domain. He is of his own free will to respond to her, or not to respond to her. His choice, no gun to his head, he could say, but doesn't say, I cannot answer that. <br><br>Watch Mark's eyes, his breathing, his mouth, as he responds to the Reporters questions. He has many micro-expressions, millisecond facial reactions that are of seethe, even loathe of her simple "questions". He is recounting, the time after he picked Dy up from the airport till they got on the road to his home. This from 10:00-12:30. This was for him a conquest won, a holiday to be spent with his son? as he says in the first mins of the interview that Nostalgia is everything to him.  What he wanted Dylan to experience, he committed to. Traveling, adventures, sports hall of fame, pizza in Brooklyn - all dissipates, and becomes quite polar, goes SOUTH, upon the 10:00 min mark. All goes south once Dylan enters the interview on an intimate level, he picking him up and then once they are on the road to his house. Chronologically by his own accounts. <br>10:00 on, his words setting the pace of Dy entering. 11:42 he is passive and speaking, of Dylan. He changes like a chameleon, 11:44 he is reflecting back to his known real what did happen. His face is of contempt, contempt for DYLAN. He then is Mr. Nice, continue to watch him, 11:55 he switches, his head tilts he stretches his neck/jaw/mouth muscle, humor banter enters. As I believe this is his craft. He is a bar stool talker. <br><br>12:02: he says " wudd'nt my first choice" he is clearly not happy in his recall, that moment, he shows arrogance, he appeases by again adding lighter speak, he @12:14 then makes a face scarier than the devil himself ..if you are 13, on the receiving end. He is sober, he is not being interrogated. Can you imagine him out of control? on alcohol? heated? angry? you 13, weighing 100lbs. <br><br>Now play it again, from 10:00 to 12:30 - NO SOUND. Concentrate on his face. His facial reactions as he speaks. Do not think about who he is talking to, but of who he is speaking of, His SON.

Hi I judst read up on this case and commented in the last thread about this csse.  I really feel the Dad saw the movie "Mask" with Cher and is imitating emotions and themes from the move ie Rocky's mother encouraging him to map out places across the U.S.A that he wants to visit on a motorcycle w his friend.  At the end of movie, Rocky dies of a terrible disease and his Mom goes and looks at the map of USA w all the places he wanted to visit and bc he is dead she says "now you can go anywhere you want".  His talking about Dylan in the video reminded me of things from the movie and i believe he is imitating emotions/themes from the movie.  Dylans Dad wears Harley Davidson hat and movie Mask is about Harley bikers.  I wonder if this movie would have some clue as to what happened to Dylan since the Dad seems to be "living through" the movie

Mark is a sappy sentimentalist.  I think many criminals are. It's a form of self indulgence, and when similar emotions aren't returned by people, their sentimentality turns very quickly to hatred. These people are enamored of their own feelings, not of others. They are not concerned with the best interests of others. They are concerned with their own personal injury.

I think I may just be repeating here, but off the charts sensitivity about Dylan wanting to spend time with his friends and how well he understood that, even though when they get together it's just me and him.  Oh yeah, and his friends. And I understand that. multiple past tense references, too many explanations.  Take a nap because it feels good to be home? Huh?  Dylan said there were two places he could get reception in my room and in one corner of the living room, but he didn't go in my room.  Huh?  Having watched the whole interview, I wonder whether Dylan made it to the house at all. Are there people who saw him at the house.  That movie seems like it didn't happen.  I wonder also a lot about premeditation. All the work for a court ordered visitation and no plans for Thanksgiving.  Calling Dylan from Durango the next day to ask him if he'd decided what he wants to do.  He was also quick to answer Dylan would be wearing same clothes as Sunday, when he would have packed enough for a week.  His denial when asked whether he was involved in the disappearance was not reliable.  "Would never harm" "would never do anything to harm", etc.  textbook.  Expressing contempt for mother appears to be a priority -- who would be focussed on this at a time like that.  In addition to the disparagement about never met a stranger, etc. I didn't really like the way he talked about their trip to Walmart and how Dylan is "adamant" about having his snacks, etc.  He seems really impressed with the attention he devoted to taking Dylan to visit these sports places and you wonder how he would react to say a 13 year old who didn't appreciate all the effort he went through for him or who didn't want to be with him for Thanksgiving.

Anon @ 5:21--I am the anon that wrote the "Mask" post and I couldn't have summed it up any better and agree about the sappy sentimentality felt by criminals and also abusers.  I do think they often find sympathetic movie characters to compare themselves too--like with an abusive partner after Mom leaves him and takes the kids the abusive Dad will indulge himself by thinking he is "just like" a sympathetic movie character like "Mrs. Doubtfire" who is just motivated by love and also they can then pity themselves and it does fuel their anger bc how can anyone see they are a wonderful person making sacrifices to see their kids like Mrs Doubtfire.<br>This guy is comparing himself I believe to Cher's boyfriend or to Cher herself in the movie Mask (both loved Rocky even though he was very deformed) and helped him map out motorcycle trip destination points around USA to help give him something to look forward to.  Both were examples of very loving parents although the mother Cher struggled w drugs and alcohol (to some extent to dull the pain of knowing what a terrible condition her son has).  At the end of the movie, Cher goes to wake up her son and cannot bc he has died from his disease.  She then instinctively goes to get drugs from her drug box but it is empty and she is tired of taking drugs to dull her pain so she throws the box against the wall and shatters into pieces.  Anyway I just sense he identifies with this movie in a delusional way--possible maybe some kind of clue in the movie?  Don't know.

Also:  I am not comparing Dylan to Rocky--just that the father delusionally identifies w Cher or Cher's boyfriend who are examples of flawed parents who do love their son.

Oh, also, some other weird coincidences from movie:  Rocky is really into collecting baseball cards ( Dylan's father loves baseball and thinks Dylan does too).  In movie, Cher is so upset the principal accept Rocky into the mainstream classes at his new school bc people are biased against him bc of his disease/appearance. In video, Dylan's Dad becomes overcome w emotion talking about how Dylan at his new school was unfairly prevented from playing ootball at his new school even though it is (I believe he says) a "mainstream" school and everyone should be accepted into football (like people were <br>unfairly biased towards Dylan).

anon @ 5:54<br><br>It  has been such a long time since I have seen the movie Mask.  I would like to watch it again to see what you are referring to.  I knew someone with a criminal mind  and he used to identify with Billy in Carousel, so I think you might be onto something there. It would be interesting to see what movies and books are in Mark Redwine's house.

I just watched all 39 mins of the Mark Redwine interview.  <br><br>In his references to time, there is a clock on the wall that the camera person zooms past at around 31:30 and at the end of the interview.  Surely Mark uses that clock, and could be a lot more accurate about the timeline.<br><br>Mark only tears up when talking about Dylan in conjunction with talking about baseball or Nascar.  When he is just speaking about Dylan there is no tears, catch in his voice or sad facial expressions.  Mark does get teary eyed when talking about baseball stadiums, especially Wrigley Field.<br><br>Mark is so vitriolic about Dylan's mother that the [female] interviewer is visibly and audibly uncomfortable.  At around 34:00 Mark states that a parent "not knowing" what happened to their child is the worst thing that can happen.  I think he is speaking about his ex wife and is enjoying her pain.

The 10:00 mark of the interview, he tells the reporter that he had just finished a job, goes on to say why they went to Walmart. His said, immediately from the airport they went " to Walmart".<br><br>He says prior of Dylan of their travels, in Brooklyn of the quest for NY pizza. He could not believe how much DY could eat. <br><br>Walmart, he then contradicts his own self as a father providing for Dylan, once he had Dylan for this visitation. He states he was on a job, had nothing at home, he never uses the word FOOD.<br><br>He says things. His purpose does not equal the intent of going to Walmart. It doesn't jive. He hires an atty, he wins visitation, Dylan is sent to him. Dylan is on school break, Dylan knowing by his mother's own said to him, that TG dinner was planned and was to be an event, her/his family. He would not be with her, but sent to Dad. DY his excitement to be able to be with his buddies, they too on TG break. Was for Dy to look forward to, seeing his Buddies, an exchange of sorts. This adds. <br><br>MR on shopping. His own said @11:00, "food". He does not say FOOD, he says: Grab enough things to Sustain ourselves for a day or two while we were figuring out, I didn't even buy anything for Thanksgiving, I didn't have any concrete plans. <br><br>Sustain sounds like Rations. His said though is not Food, but things, for a day or two. No need for sustaining Dy after the day or two ? he had plans? he says he had no plans.<br><br>His excuse is that no plans were made for TG. He Omits the word FOOD. He omits Food then from the purchases at Walmart. He introduces the movies Dy found, Food isle and Electronic isles are not conjoined. They then were inside the store, yet not in the Food section? Sustain DY no, sustain us, for a day or two with things. Things? to occupy? <br><br>His Son, he was awarded, this a Holiday, and his said is that they went to Walmart immediately from the Airport, this then was his planned. <br><br>His said I didn't even buy anything for TG, this then was pre-empted, him not to buy, prior to Dy arriving. TG wasn't a plan, was not in his plans, it then was not to be shared with Dy. Listen to his statements. " I didn't even buy" was not of their inside Walmart. Was of him, knowing DY was going to arrive. He hired an Atty, he fought, won, Dy sent to him. This known to him prior to November 17th. Dy was awarded, and he made the choice not to buy anything on his own accord, no plans on his own accord. Turkey or no Turkey it is that TG was not <br>" in his plans". Was not to be. <br><br>Dy wasn't going to be around? his planned? he made zero commitment to Dylan pre his arrival, which is the unexpected.

Moving along his own said timeline. After Walmart, came McDonald's, not his plan. He to say he could not recall what time Dy arrived to the airport. 6:00pm, 6:20 ish, I don't remember. LE to offer that DY arrived at the airport 5:46pm. <br><br>Dy captured on Walmart camera 7:05. Dy, Mom said, Dy responded a text to her, this the last, that Dad had picked him up, text to her 7:06. The mixed bag time of Mark, he was late, he plays it as it was the plane came in late. He though uses the word " immediate" they went to Walmart. His planned. They leave the Walmart and then? his plan was to have a " Sit down" with Dylan. Sit down Restaurant.  <br><br>11:42 of YT: McDonald's his exact said. No Food is mentioned.<br><br>MR: We went to McDonald's, I wanted to go to a sit down restaurant, sit down and talk to him, this was his plan. Dylan did not respond well to this. Why? this is my own thought, the " Sit Down" in a restaurant equated talking. As in He doing the talking, not Dylan. MR's despise of Elaine in the entry of this interview, he wanted to drink? he in his comfort zone? sit down restaurant. Liquid courage to get his point across. I believe that Dylan scared him. Dylan's ability to make choices at age 13, scared Mark. He Dylan to present his own truth of his father, to the court, was something he feared. This why the sit down, he would be the control, Dy the sponge. He wanted DY to hear him out, man to man? <br><br>Dy knowing the court activity of present being custody, he the reason. His dad is leaving out information here, it's not that difficult to figure out.<br><br>He wanted Dylan sat down, that he could " garner" information, and say his said, in public. Dy not able to react or retreat. I get it. Dy did chose McDonald's? it is on the shopping row, from the Walmart, I think Mark pissed off pulled into the McDonald's as an appeasement. That DY would not<br>conform to his plan, a " sit down". What 13 yr old doesn't want to go to McDonald's the flag. <br><br>His own said: We didn't even eat IN,..McDonald's, we got it in the truck, went to the the drive thru and were eating it on our way home, so.. * do not read into it, it is his statement. <br><br>His NOT said, we didn't eat inside, we went through the drive thru, ordered food, and ate the food on our way home. WE DIDN'T even EAT, We got it, in the truck, Went to the drive thru, we're eating it on our way home = anger, no food. He drove through alright, the parking lot and went TO the drive thru, not thru it, food wasn't purchased.<br> <br>" Mark was pissed that Dy didn't want to have a sit down - the Atty meeting planned the following AM" <br>We got it in the truck, ate it on the way home, yes they did. He Mark to Dylan " lets get it straight, who's on first" verbal abusive speak on the 45 min drive - His intent of the sit down, was for him to gain advantages, and it was Dy that didn't comply. This didn't set the tone, the tone was already set, as he MR had his own plans designed. His Monday AM meeting with his Atty.  <br><br>DY asking to see his friends to cherry Mark's cake, this at the same time, after leaving McDonald's he said, Dy asked him. I don't think DY asked him, I think it was of DY defending himself, I don't have to stay with you! I have friends who know I am here, he had made contact via texting with Ryan, I made it. When did MR take Dy's phone away is the question?

The thing that I notice with alot of these cases….. outside of the SA rules...<br><br>These parents spend more time talking about anything but their missing child. <br><br>What they did, when they did it, why they didn’t come out (this guy and the Celis parents, why they "understand" there is focus on them and thanks for you help etc) <br><br>If my son was missing, I would not care about anything but finding him. I would be a panic. I would not care if anyone suspected me unless it physically stopped me from looking.   <br><br>If someone asked me about my own blame...I would likely ignore it. I would not care. I would want to find my son. <br>I could not waste time talking about what I did, how much I have cooperated, or how I let them search my  home. I would have this NEED to talk about my son. <br><br>What he was wearing, where his friends live, every photo I could find I would have up, places he liked to go. What he liked to eat. Was he shy, outgoing. <br><br>Especially at Dylans age. He has his own life, friends things he likes to do. None of that is mentioned. He doesnt talk about where the friends live, where he would have to walk to head in that direction, does he like to skateboard did he go there. That he called Ryan, asked Ryan when he spoke to them last, did he say anything about walking or hitch hiking. All these things a normal parent would do. <br><br>They would look everywhere, call and ask everything. <br><br>Like with Billie Jean. She didn’t ask tons of questions. In fact often said “I have not had a chance to ask Shawn” <br><br>BS. This is where I would fisrt call her out!! That’s the first thing you do. Someone is missing and you saw them last, I am going to be in your face asking you every single detail. You didnt just "not get around to it" when this is the only thing that you should care about right now. This is everything!<br><br>I just wish SA could convict these parents. <br><br><br><br>I have a friend whos 16 yr old ran away. They knew that because they fought with her over a boy on the phone, they told her not to see him. She told them she would do what she wanted and hung up. When they got home, she was gone along with her purse, clothes etc. <br><br>My friend and her husband were on the news immediately…. She was hysterical. Talking about what she likes, where she may have gone, where they have checked. She says she called all her friends. None of them have heard from her. Called the boyfriend he wont answer the phone. ETC ETC ETC..<br><br>All the focus RIGHT AWAY on finding her. And she was a run away. She was not just missing or kidnapped. Those usually dont end well. Yet she spoke of nothing but her daughter. Finding her. Tons of photos. Seeing that it is so clear the difference. <br><br><br>Thankfully they found her the next day with the boyfriend at a park. But the panic she had was clear. There was no question about it. <br><br>This guy, the Celis family, Billie Dunn. The opposite. There is this calmness. No need to go on and on about their child, where they may have gone, begging for anyone that may have seen them to call. The case is solved to them. They are now  just in cover up mode.<br><br>And Becky Celis and her need to "greive in private" as she put it. You just told us your child is dead! You dont greive for missing. You look for missing. You greive for dead.<br><br>The reporter should have called her on that. I would have before I knew about SA. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

I hope that SA becomes more popular.<br><br>I think it really needs to be out there front and center. I think everyone needs to pay more attention to what people say. <br><br>Reporters need to be trained in this. Police, jurors (i didnt say lawyers cause they would just teach their clients how to lie better). <br><br>Espeically when we have missing kids.<br><br>So many parents are clearly getting away with murder.<br><br><br>So Peter thank you for creating this site so people like me can learn. It needs to be spread more and more!<br><br>And I know I tell everyone about it. <br><br>

He explains that he understands being the object of suspicion because ' he (Dylan) was last seen with me'. It's an odd way of putting it but shows how conscious he is of being a suspect. Missing people are often described in company as ' was last seen with'. If Mark had left of his own accord he could have been seen by many people in the company of whomever, whether they recognised him or not. The father tacitly displays his knowledge that Mark wasn't seen by/with anyone since the night before his 'disappearance'ie his guilty knowledge that such a sighting is impossible.<br><br>The not ' knowing what time it was because I don't look at the clock but I thought blah blah because I was very tired' etc is pure Amanda Knox! So he must remember NOT looking at the clock. Strange that the only time he's clear on is the 4am of the night before!!! And he supposedly goes to bed leaving his son up!! sit down, sit down, pacing, ran up, go down. <br>Again he gives himself away with the mobile coverage. Either D was in his bedroom OR he himself checked D's phone coverage.<br><br> This may have been a loss of temper murder - raging over the son he hardly knows being more interested in his friends, videos and texting that listening to dad's self-pitying stories- but given the belittlement of and resentment displayed in his characterisation of Dylan AND his mother I wouldn't rule out SOME premeditation, along the lines of ''If I see that my relationship with Dylan is beyond repair I will 'dump' him''<br>Tragically for men like this other people have no intrinsic value beyond what they can provide, even their own children.

Sadly I think this killer felt his child's boredom, distress or contempt as reason to obliterate him. His fantasy pop-son relationship is now preserved in his own mind as the other party cannot walk away...It's so tragic that children can be forced to visit parents they don't know/want to know/are afraid of/are being abused by. <br><br>These father- child killings are an extension of also frequent husband- wife domestic violence killings. The idea of wife and children as property is ancient. Some men have no identity or self worth when they don't have 'their' family to boss about/control and all hell breaks lose when they see themselves old and alone through their own fault. 'If I can't have you no-one will' is the same.<br><br>I hope the LE find the evidence they need to bring Dylan's killer to justice.

Anon @9:49--That is interesting about how someone you knew with a criminal mind identified with that character from Carousel--I wish I had seen the movie so I would know the character!  I think a lot of criminal minds do identify with and draw some of their behaviors (or really I should say perceptions of their own behaviors) from how they perceive or identify with characters in movies.  I would be very interested what books and movies are in Mark's house particularly since he mentions "movies" from the $5 bin at Walmart--my guess is they were a big part of his life.
