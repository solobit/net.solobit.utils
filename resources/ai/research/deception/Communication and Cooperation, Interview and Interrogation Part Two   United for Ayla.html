				<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">In <a title="Communication and Cooperation, Interview and Interrogation Part One" href="http://united4ayla.com/communication-and-cooperation-interview-and-interrogation-part-one/" target="_blank">Communication and Cooperation, Interview and Interrogation Part One</a>, we looked at statements made by LE that showed how different sides of Ayla’s family did or didn’t cooperate or communicate with LE.</span> It appears that the maternal family has continued to cooperate and communicate since Ayla “went missing”. The communication and cooperation with the paternal side and Courtney seems to have started a downhill slide sometime in January to the point where it basically stopped sometime in March.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">In Part Two, we’re going to look at how Statement Analysis is used during interviews and interrogations, and how it’s use, may have affected the level of communication and cooperation with Justin, Courtney, Elisha and Phoebe.</span></p>
<p>Some of us are familiar with Statement Analysis and some are not. Peter Hyatt has done SA on several of the DiPietros’ comments. Whether you agree with Peter’s analysis or not, law enforcement does use SA in interviews and interrogations. Here are some articles from the FBI and other LE sources that explain Statement Analysis and how it is used on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Originally from <a href="http://crimeandclues.com/2013/03/02/statement-analysis-what-do-suspects-words-really-reveal/" target="_blank">FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin </a></p>
<p>By Susan H. Adams, M.A.<br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">
Special Agent Adams teaches statement analysis as part of interviewing and interrogation courses at the FBI Academy.</span></p>
<p>(In statement analysis, investigators examine words, independent of case facts, to detect deception.)</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">This article gives a brief overview of statement analysis.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">It examines four components of statement analysis–parts of speech </span>(pronouns, nouns, and verbs)<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">, extraneous information, lack of conviction, and the balance of the statement.</span> A word of caution is warranted here. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">There is much more to statement analysis than what is provided in this article; space limitations preclude incorporating other statement analysis components, such as the remaining parts of speech and the numerous indicators of missing information.</span> Still, armed with the information presented in this article, investigators will be able to use these basic techniques to gain insight into a suspect prior to conducting an interview. By learning more about a suspect and determining whether that person is being deceptive, they have a much better chance of identifying the guilty party and gaining a confession.</p>
<p><b>The Technique</b><br>
Statement analysis follows a two-step process. First, investigators determine what is typical of a truthful statement, referred to as the norm. They then look for any deviation from this norm. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Truthful statements differ from fabricated ones in both content and quality</span>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Although spoken words can be analyzed, investigators inexperienced in statement analysis will find it easier to begin by examining written statements</span>. Investigators can make transcripts of oral statements. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Or, even better, they can have suspects write a statement that details what they did from the time they woke up until the time they went to bed. This account provides a totally untainted version of the day’s events and increases the validity of the analysis.</span> Statement analysis is an aid that can be used to obtain a confession; it is not an end in itself. Therefore, whenever possible, investigators should analyze the statement before interviewing the suspect.</p>
<p><b>Important Parts Of Speech</b><br>
Parts of speech form the foundation of statement analysis. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">To analyze a statement, investigators first need to examine the individual parts of speech, particularly pronouns, nouns, and verbs, and to establish the norm for each.</span> If a deviation from the norm appears, they then should ask, “Why?”</p>
<p><b>Pronouns</b><br>
Pronouns are parts of speech that take the place of nouns. Common examples of personal pronouns include I, me, you, he, she, we, they, and it. In statement analysis, particular attention should be given to the personal pronouns “I” and “we” and all possessive pronouns, such as my, our, your, his, her, etc. The Pronoun “I” Investigators have noted that truthful people give statements using the pronoun “I,” which is first person, singular. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any deviation from this norm deserves close scrutiny, for it could be an indication that the person is not totally committed to the facts in the statement and, therefore, is not telling the whole truth.</span></p>
<p><i>Let’s look at Phoebe’s statement. Notice she changes from the pronoun “I” to “you” and “your” to “my” depending on the topic she’s discussing.</i></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/dipietro-family-kept-out-of-homefor-two-weeks_2012-01-06.html"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Investigation kept family out of home for two weeks</span></a></strong></span><br>
“<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b> understand that the public feels they have the right to know,” she said. “<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b> believe they will once Ayla is returned.</p>
<p>“It’s been very hard,” she said. “<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span></b>‘re worried about <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span></b> children. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your</span></b> granddaughter is missing.</p>
<p>“How do <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></b> go through the motions to even comprehend the word Christmas?</p>
<p>“<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My</span></b> son was in shambles — just crying and shaking — and there was nothing <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b> could do to comfort him,” she said. “<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span></b> feel so helpless.”</p>
<p>Contact from the outside world could be a mixed blessing, she said.</p>
<p>“The phone rings and <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></b> get jittery, because <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></b>‘re hoping they’re calling because they found Ayla, but it could also be the media,” she said. “It could be somebody calling to say they care for <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></b> and love <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you </span></b>and offer to help.”</p>
<p>“<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span></b> can’t ask <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span></b> friends, ‘What did you do in this situation?’”</p>
<p>“<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My</span></b> house was in shambles,” she recalled. “<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b> don’t even know how to describe that. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b> felt violated. Along with the fact that someone took <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my </span></b>granddaughter from <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span></b> home, (the police) came in and did what they did.”</p>
<p><i>Why isn’t Phoebe totally committed to parts of her statement?</i></p>
<p>The following written narrative begins with a clear commitment, then shows a definite lack of commitment:</p>
<p>“I got up at 7:00 when my alarm went off. I took a shower and got dressed. I decided to go out for breakfast. I went to the McDonald’s on the corner. Met a man who lives nearby. Talked with him for a few minutes. I finished breakfast and drove to work.”</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">The first four sentences of the statement match the norm of first person, singular–the use of the pronoun “I”; the next two sentences show deviation, because this pronoun is missing from the statement.</span> What caused the writer to stop using the pronoun “I”? <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any change in the use of pronouns is significant, and at this point, investigators should realize that the statement now becomes devoid of personal involvement.</span> Could there be tension between the writer and the man mentioned in the statement? During the interview, investigators should draw out specifics about this relationship to determine if this part of the narrative is really true or if the writer omitted information.</p>
<p><i>Notice Justin’s use of pronouns in this statement. He says, “we’ve cooperated”, “We’ve made”, then he drops *who* is more than willing, then he says, “We’re cooperating”. We would expect Justin to say, “we’re more than willing”. Why the deviation when saying “more than willing”?</i></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/Toddlers-father-says-he-took-a-polygraph-exam.html"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Toddler’s father says he took a polygraph exam</span></a></strong></span> 1/14/12<br>
Asked if other family members had taken a polygraph exam, DiPietro said he was not sure.</p>
<p>“I just know about myself,” he said. “Again, anything (police have) asked us to do,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <b>we’ve</b></span><b> </b>cooperated.<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We’ve</span> </b>made ourselves available to them.<b></b></p>
<p>“Anytime they’ve had a question about something, if they want us to come to the station … more than willing.<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We’re</span> </b>cooperating. There’s nothing to hide here.”<b></b></p>
<p><i>When it’s this easy for us to notice in a simple statement given to media, how much do you think the professionals were able to find during repeated interviews and interrogations with the DiPietros and Courtney?</i></p>

Evaluating Truthfulness and Detecting Deception</p>
<p>By DAVID MATSUMOTO, Ph.D., HYI SUNG HWANG, Ph.D., LISA SKINNER, J.D., and MARK FRANK, Ph.D.</p>
<p><b>Statement Analysis</b><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">
Investigators also can improve their ability to detect lies by becoming skillful at statement analysis, which applies internalized grammatical rules that stem from the language acquisition part of the brain to an individual’s written or spoken words.</span> In fact, people apply these rules to what they read and hear every day when they make a judgment about whether or not something is truthful or deceptive. While people may say that their belief is based upon their “gut,” in reality, their brain is applying these internalized grammatical rules to the information. By doing so, investigators can gain valuable insight into a person’s thoughts, motivations, and ideas.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Statement analysis involves examining several aspects of someone’s words, including verbs describing communication and uncompleted action; changes in verb tense; minimizing, intensifying, and editing adverbs; extraneous information; unique sensory details; and statement structure, which identifies the person’s focus—on the incident or somewhere else.</span> Research has shown that distinct differences exist between a deceptive statement and a truthful one. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">By using the techniques of statement analysis, investigators can more readily detect truthfulness or deception in an individual’s words.</span> With these insights, investigators become more efficient and effective in their abilities and gain better focus on the investigation.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">After taking a written statement from a suspect, investigators should apply statement analysis techniques to identify key areas to pursue in the interview.</span> For example, if a suspect’s statement jumps in sequence from the early evening to the next morning, ignoring the time that the crime occurred, it likely would be noted by editing adverbs (e.g., then, later). Additionally, noting changes in noun and pronoun usage and verbs of communication can prove critically important as they can signify areas for further exploration. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Once officers complete their analysis, they can begin the interview by jumping straight to such areas in the statement, thereby catching suspects off guard because of the immediate attention on the part of their statement where they feel vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><i>Not only does the FBI use SA, they also train others in the use of SA. To those who say, “SA is just a bunch of BS.” I disagree. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">The top law enforcement agencies in the United States both use and promote it</span>. </i></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.nvcja.org/inservicetraining/inservicetrainingcalendar/tabid/67/ctl/viewdetail/mid/386/itemid/359/d/20110511/FBI-Interview%2c-Interrogations-and-Statement-Analysis-Course.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="color: #3366ff;">FBI Training Statement Analysis Interrogation </span></a></strong></span><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">
This two day class reviews the basics of Interview and Interrogations but then teaches the dynamics of performing a comprehensive Statement Analysis</span>. The class has been taught twice at the NVCJA and received very positive comments from all of the students who have taken it. Supervisory Special Agent Kevin Daly teaches this class at the FBI Academy for their agents.</p>
<p><i style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Here’s an example of how Statement Analysis was used and how it’s use held up under scrutiny.</i></p>

<p><b>Deceptive but Truthful: Is it Possible?</b></p>

<p><b>The Question is Raised</b><br>
This may sound like an oxymoron, however in light of the adjoining article, “Statement Analysis Put to the Test, a Case Study”, I felt this question should be addressed. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">With this statement – Deceptive but Truthful – I am raising the question; If a statement is found to have many indications of deception, does that mean that the event reported did not happen?</span> The answer is NO!</p>
<p>There are many reasons for people to be deceptive, and the deceptive person in each investigation may have their own specific reason, however, I believe a basic motivation is simply to avoid the consequences of their actions. There are also many ways for people to be deceptive. They may straight out lie, stating something that just did not happen. They may tell half-truths, or make exaggerations, which bend the truth. They may also be completely truthful with everything they said, but they just&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;say everything! In this instance they tell you the truth, but leave out incriminating information.</p>
<p>The statements where people provide half-truths, make exaggerations, or in some way distort the truth, are areas where we must proceed cautiously. Before making a determination that the event reported did not happen, we must seek to find out where they are lying and why. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">In the adjoining article on statement analysis, the statement provided by the victim had many indications of deception present.</span> Taking that into consideration along with information that there was recently a rash of residential burglaries in the area where the victim reported this crime, and the prior criminal record of some of the players, it would be easy to make an assumption that the car-jacking&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;happen, and that these characters were up to something else in town. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">In fact, that was our first reaction. However, upon conducting a detailed analysis and follow-up interview with the victim, we were confident that the car-jacking did happen, but not so confident that the victim was being 100% truthful.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Addressed within the companion article titled, “Statement Analysis put to the Test, a Case Study”, are the areas of deception observed within the victims statement </span>(refer to other article for details)<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">.</span> Upon conducting a thorough investigation and detailed interview with the victim, we were able to determine where the victim “lied” by leaving out information he believed to be unimportant (outside issue). We were also able to determine where there was tension or stress during the course of his day, and to determine the cause of that tension, to see if it had any direct connection to the reported crime. And we were able to determine, through a detailed examination and analysis, where the subject “lied” by leaving out significant information, in this particular case it was “who had the gun?”. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Through the systematic analysis of the victims written statement, in conjunction with a thorough investigation, we were able to answer these questions and bring this case to a successful conclusion.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">This included the arrests of all three suspects </span>(Georgio, Gerald and Donna)<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">, recovery of the stolen vehicle and recovery of the weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">The final outcome upon all three suspects pleading guilty was that Georgio admitted having the gun during this robbery, and Donna admitted lying about who had the gun because she was good friends with Georgio. Also the victim, Keith, was Georgio’s lover so he did not want to put the gun in his hand either. And then there is Gerald, who initially confessed to his involvement in the car-jacking but denied possessing the weapon, stood firm with his statements, and was found to be the most truthful of all!</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">In closing, the victim in this case was in fact the victim of a car-jacking, however he provided a statement about it which contained several signals of deception.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Therefore, the complete analysis of the victims statement, along with a detailed inquiry into this statement, was able to aid the investigation, assist the Prosecution and to reach the ultimate goal of uncovering and documenting the TRUTH.</span></p>

		<p>Happy Easter to All!  We are now in the Octave of Easter and in the Easter season until Pentecost Sunday May 19th.   We’ll all never cease praying that Ayla is located during this time, and that someone will be soon been inspired to come forth with the truth.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I know you will all keep her in your prayers on her 3rd birthday April 4th. The Mass intentions at our former parish in St. Peter, DeLand, Florida have been requested for Ayla that day. If anyone would like to follow along with the scriptures of the day they are listed on Ayla Reynolds, Ayla’s Angels page. </p>
<p>Prayers for all &amp; special love this most beautiful of seasons.</p>

		<p>Thank you Mountain Mama for the explanation of SA as used by LE. I had no idea there was so much more than what we have learned to this point. For example, I remember the statement you and Dee used so frequently when explaining SA, “The statement is the only thing that is alive in SA” but yet the pronoun used to describe the individual making the statement is critical as well? </p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">In statement analysis, particular attention should be given to the personal pronouns “I” and “we” and all possessive pronouns, such as my, our, your, his, her, etc.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">The Pronoun “I” Investigators have noted that truthful people give statements using the pronoun “I,” which is first person, singular.</span></p>
<p>So if I try to SA a statement I must remember the person description is just words, not the person themselves?</p>

		<p>John there is much more to SA than there was room to put in this post. This touched on some of the basics though. To answer your question…the subject is dead, the statement is alive. You have to focus on the statement itself, not on who made the statement. The same analysis applies regardless who made the statement. After the statement analysis is done you can go back and compare the results with what information you know of the person who said it.</p>

		<p>So is the deceptiveness determined when going back and comparing the SA of the statement to the known “norm” of the subject, or is the deceptiveness only determined by the statement itself? </p>
<p>Sorry, this is such a fascinating area of discussion and I know so little about it.</p>

		<p>You find the sensitivity indicators in the statement and then you compare them with the person’s “norm”. Remember there are many reasons for sensitivity, not just deception.</p>

		<p>I found this very interesting.  I did not know there was so much involved.  I have always believed that when a person  states  “I” that there is a personal identification of their feelings and are truthful. I find it hard to believe that the W4 may think they are<br>
fooling MSP and LE.  They may have rehearsed what they planned on saying as a group, but it is the unexpected detailed questions that are the most crucial in determining whether the statement is a lie, or the truth. The W4 will not take the chance of having a public interview since their body language and use of words will be analyzed. MM I admire the way you explained how “the subject is dead, the statement is alive.” I wonder how often they were interviewed in the beginning and if an attorney was present to advise them.  Would LE compare the statements prior to them having a lawyer and compare the statements when they had an attorney present?</p>

		<p>Mary Ann I used Peter Hyatt’s explanation for the subject is dead, the statement is alive, I can’t take credit for it. I think LE has reviewed all their statements more than once. They would be able to tell from the statements when a lawyer coached them, it’s that obvious. Wha I think would be hard for the W4/5/6/? would be when they had to start from Z and go back to A like the retired police officer mentioned in Part 1. It had to be hard to keep their story straight then.</p>

		<p>yes…forget everything you know about the case, and the person making the statement, and just look at the words…<br>
then analyze for patterns of usage for a baseline of sorts, a “template” for when the words indicate truth, a natural flow and consistency in pronouns and descriptive terms…<br>
and then compare this template to any outliers from this baseline pattern, like changes in usage, consistency, ranking order, missing elements(pronouns, etc…) or extra elements, statements in the negative, repeated words, abrupt cut-offs… areas that deviate from the baseline, or are “invisible”/in the negative to it are ares of sensitivity, for what ever reason, and these are points to further explore…</p>
<p>I imagine some of these red flags were subjects like Justin and Derek’s activities the morning and early afternoon of December 16th, 2011, and again later that night during his trip for wine…didn’t the media report early on  that he was gone for three hours that night? that’s a long trip to buy wine…<br>
other possible red flags: drugs, violence, parenting skills, who put Ayla to bed that night, whose car justin took to get the wine, the blood evidence in the house, how Ayla’s blood got int he basement in such a large amount, why she never made her doctor’s appt that day, and WHO WAS HOME THAT DAY, not just evening..etc…there are too many red flags for any detectives comfort I would imagine, and all of them point right back at Justin, and those covering up this terrible secret they all share</p>
<p>Justin is darn near a textbook example for SA, and so is the rest of his family…<br>
LE knew something was not right from the get go, and have been working hard to prove the burden of guilt every day since…they know who did it, but lack the minute details the legal courts require to convict without a reasonable doubt..thank goodness time is on their side, and a whole lot of people who care…</p>

		<p>Not to worry Emerald, Phoebe explains it all here. What does SA say about the word “normal”?</p>
<p>She reiterated, however, that there wasn’t a party at the home, as some media outlets reported.”There wasn’t a party here. It was just a normal day,” she said. <a href="http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/dipietro-family-kept-out-of-homefor-two-weeks_2012-01-06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/dipietro-family-kept-out-of-homefor-two-weeks_2012-01-06.html</a></p>

		<p>From above article;</p>
<p>“They want to get my daughter home, and this house is just proof of the extent they will go to find her,” he said. “They don’t have to care about me, they don’t have to care about my mom. But, they care about my daughter, and I know that. They’re not holding anything back to find her. And, if they have to go through this house again, that’s OK.”</p>
<p>***Justin said LE was not holding anything back to find her, his next sentence starts with “And”, if they have to go through this house again…What information is missing here?</p>

		<p>exactly my point…she says NORMAL DAY, after being asked about that NIGHT, and a party at NIGHT…seems to me the time of the incident is also sensitive…I have a feeling whatever befell precious little Ayla was much earlier in the day than Justin’s evening trip out for wine, as you say, “leaving” often indicates, in the statement, the death or removal of a victim from the scene…, and this makes the mid-morning/afternoon a very sensitive subject…especially including the “play-date” Derek Tudela has never explained…</p>

		<p>Very well put together MM. You explained the concepts of SA very well and gave good examples of statements that were sensitive and statements that were deceptive. It can be sensitive without being deceptive. I’ve been reading but not commenting much the last week or so. I’ll be back tomorrow to look at this again and add some comments. Happy Easter everyone.</p>

		<p>I remember both you and MM telling us that sensitivity and deception are two different things. I still try to remember this whenever I reread statements and when new statements arise.</p>

		<p>Sorry MM 10:17 p.m. for the error. I have to be sharper when reading.  I don’t know how to get back to you when there is not a<br>
“reply” following a response.  I have one more question that I thought of after commenting. Would the statements made from the W/4,5,6, and possibly 7 before they had an attorney allowed to be entered in court?</p>

		<p>IMO the only way they wouldn’t be allowed is if their attorney can prove their rights were violated in some way when they made the statements. Someone with better legal knowledge than I have could give a better answer though.</p>

		<p>I recall at the beginning when Justin was talking for those few days, he said everything and everyone was voluntarily cooperating. If they voluntarily cooperated then I do not see how thier initial statements would not be admissable. JMO</p>

		<p>Miranda Warnings Don’t Always Apply<br>
The US Supreme Court firmly established this principle in a 2010 decision. In that case, a murder suspect refused to sign an acknowledgment of his Miranda rights, then later made statements that were used against him in his conviction for the crime.</p>
<p>The Court ruled that the burden was on the suspect to invoke his Miranda rights, and his failure to sign the acknowledgment essentially amounted to a waiver of those rights.</p>
<p>Miranda Warnings Don’t Always Apply<br>
There are two very basic prerequisites before the police must issue a Miranda warning to a suspect:</p>
<p>    The suspect is in police custody<br>
    The suspect is under interrogation</p>
<p>It’s crucial to understand these prerequisites because if you aren’t formally in police custody(in other words, NAMED A FORMAL SUSPECT AND ARRESTED), and you aren’t being interrogated, the police don’t have to give you a Miranda warning. Both Prerequisites must be happening at the same time. This, in turn, means that the police can use anything you say until those two requirements are fulfilled as evidence against you.</p>
<p>LE has never named any suspects formally for this reason, and since JD and the others voluntarily walked into the police station(not brought in under arrest), to be questioned(interrogation), and did not invoke their rights, anything they said can and will be sued against them…this goes for OUI and DUI as well…you always have your rights, and can invoke them any time, but the cops only have to inform you of them when they arrest you, and not before…</p>

		<p>In <a href="http://united4ayla.com/sensitive-topics-part-i-2/" title="Sensitive Topics: Part I – Submitted by Mountain Mama" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sensitive Topics Part 1</a> – Mama said;</p>
<p>“A topic can be sensitive due to different emotions and doesn’t necessarily imply guilt. It is the reactions to these topics that give us an indication of why they are sensitive. Some of these reactions are; defend, divert, accuse, attack, lie, silence, remorse, apology etc.”</p>
<p>In the post above, we see deception is determined using a specialized SA Technique;</p>
<p>“Important Parts Of Speech<br>
Parts of speech form the foundation of statement analysis. To analyze a statement, investigators first need to examine the individual parts of speech, particularly pronouns, nouns, and verbs, and to establish the norm for each. If a deviation from the norm appears, they then should ask, “Why?””</p>
<p>There is a distinct difference that I can now visualize between Sensitivities and Deceptive Statements. Thank you for pointing this out.</p>

<p>This is actually something I read up on when you posted the sensitive topics series. It is indicators that indentify the topics. It can not be used in reversed where if we consider a topic to be sensitive, we should not allow this to create indicators that do not really exist.  <img src="./Communication and Cooperation, Interview and Interrogation Part Two   United for Ayla_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

		<p>If I have time later I’ll try to find a list of some sensitivity indicators in statement analysis. Once you know them it becomes second nature to notice them in everyday conversations without looking for them.</p>

		<p>I wonder if to some extent we pick up on some of these indicaters naturally such as when someone is telling us something and to ourselves we say, ” I’m not buying this story”  I may be that we are also picking up body language, out of the norm etc. etc.</p>

		<p>I think we do Chicky. When we get that gut feeling we need to analyze the statement made, in that way we can be sure it’s not from some pre-conceived opinion we might have of that person.</p>

		<p>“Toddler’s father says he took a polygraph exam 1/14/12<br>
Asked if other family members had taken a polygraph exam, DiPietro said he was not sure.”</p>
<p>About whether the others have taken polygraphs: We don’t have the actual quote of him saying “I’m not sure”, but even as reported by the journalist, JD has got to be lying.</p>
<p>His daughter had been kidnapped, his family is under suspicion, heavily questioned by LE . Justin doesn’t know if the others under suspicion with him — two of which lived with him, and one of which is his “long-time girlfriend” —  have taken a polygraph?</p>
<p> Please! Does Justin think we are all asleep at the wheel? Never mind. He does think he’s a superior being and we, as well as LE,  are all mindless idiots. That thought helps him resume his “normal” life and go on as if nothing has happened.</p>

		<p>I do think Penny, that Justin believed beforehand that he would be able to talk his way out of anyhting. Well we found out very early that he was outwitted, outsmarted, outthought and definately outclassed. To think that MSP was admitting to anything stated incorrectly was a result of something Justin said, instead of a way to keep them talking, is all the evidence I need to know he assumed he was superior in all aspects and found out quickly he is not all that!</p>

		<p>“…instead of a way to keep them talking, is all the evidence I need to know he assumed he was superior in all aspects and found out quickly he is not all that!”</p>
<p>I think the DiPietros and friends believed that the DiPietro family were ultimately in a superior class to Trista and her family in every way…and so anything the DiPietros did with Ayla was inherently better for her even if Ayla turned up “missing”.</p>
<p>Justin’s statement that he doesn’t owe the public anything…especially not “the way I am handling this” is so indicative of his feeling of superiority. From whence does this feeling of being better than most come from… in a chronically underemployed young man with an unenviable sexual history with women?</p>

		<p>It seems this could be a learned behavior. Remember that Phoebe was qouted as saying McCausland was”full of himself”, and we have Heidi telling him how “irresponsible” it was to verify Ayla’s blood had been found at 19 Violette Ave. Everyone associated to Justin weather familial or not, seems to know much more than LE knows in regards to investigating a case of a missing child. <img src="./Communication and Cooperation, Interview and Interrogation Part Two   United for Ayla_files/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

		<p>Actually  I think it is a great feeling of inferiority complex.  A need to put others down in order to make themselves look superior, holier than thou, “better” than the maternal family.   A need too to “look better” than the WPD by stating the “McCaouseland is full of himself”.   It’s all defense mechanism to make themselves feel better.</p>

		<p>I think it’s a combination of both Glenda. I think they thought they could outsmart LE in the beginning. They quickly found out how wrong they were. That’s when the inferiority complex came in and they tried to make LE look bad in order to make themselves look good. They were wrong again IMO.</p>

		<p>Glenda, I agree with you after MSP was introduced into the picture. I believe I agree with Penny though when it was WPD that the DiPietros thought they would be dealing with. Remember that from the Radio Shack incident, mommy has been protecting the kiddos from the local PD. But when WPD called in MSP, the DiPietros feeling of superiority quickly turned to inferiority, much like Mama said. </p>
<p>I also feel that since before Dec 17, there was a sense of superiority over the Maternal family that has not gone away even as of today. It is this reason I believe that the paternal family has still not spoken for Ayla and continues to torment the maternal family by withholding those answers. JMO</p>

I wish I could thank each of you by name but I do not want to miss anyone and I know that we had many more reading that did not comment today as well. I thank You all and Ayla thanks you for keeping her voice loud and proud!</p>

		<p>I haven’t been able to come up with a list of sensitivity indicators. Here’s a few I can remember and Dee or Emerald or someone who studies SA can probably come up with some more.</p>
<p>Persuading Words – so, since, therefore, because etc.<br>
These words are used when someone is trying to persuade or convince others in what they are saying. The use of these words doesn’t mean the statement is deceptive. When these words are used we need to look at why the need to persuade.</p>
<p>Starting a sentence with “and” – missing information.<br>
When a sentence is started with “and” there is information missing between the end of the previous sentence and the beginning of this sentence. When a sentence starts with “and” we need to question what information is missing.</p>
<p>Dee if I said this wrong, please correct me.</p>

		<p><a href="http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2012/12/sensitive-topics-versus-sensitivity.html" rel="nofollow">http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2012/12/sensitive-topics-versus-sensitivity.html</a></p>
<p>The above article is not about Ayla, it is about Hailey Dunn. I am using this article because it shows clearly the difference between a reliable and a unreliable denial and I thought it might help people see more clearly what MM and I are talking about when we reference that   It also shows that even though Hailey’s disappearance is a sensitive subject and highly emotional for Clint Dunn, the father of Hailey, he shows no sensitivity in his statement. (FYI, for those unfamiliar with the case the Shawn Adkins referenced is Hailey’s mother’s boyfriend, who is a POI)</p>
<p>“But prior to this, the father of Hailey Dunn, Clint Dunn, spoke to me about Hailey.<br>
He said he had read the analysis and knew that I believed his daughter was dead.<br>
There is nothing more sensitive, in terms of emotions, than this moment with Clint Dunn, frightened out of his mind over his missing daughter, reading that the mother’s words are revealing that she is dead.”</p>
<p>He said, “I did not kill my daughter.”</p>
<p>This sentence is without sensitivity indicators.  This sentence came at the most extreme sensitive period in his life, or any father’s life, who has lost a child.<br>
In the midst of the most sensitive topic of his life, his words showed zero sensitivity indicators, even while he was extreme in emotion.  </p>
<p>It is an indicator of truth.  </p>
<p>Sensitivity indicators are found within sentences, and are used in analysis to discern truth, deception, and missing information.  In his sentence, there were no sensitivity indicators, no deception, and no missing information. </p>
<p>“I did not kill my daughter” had:</p>
<p>1.  The first person singular verb, “I”, which is used by a human, millions of times, making it highly accurate.</p>
<p>2.  Past tense verb:  “did not” related to a past tense event.  Shawn Adkins, on the other hand, repeatedly avoided this sentence and instead opted for the future/conditional tense, “would not” when he said, “I would never harm that child” on various media appearances.  He was unable to issue a reliable denial. </p>
<p>3.  “kill” is specifically about Hailey’s death, which was the topic at hand.  Adkins used the minimizing language of “harm” instead of kill.  </p>
<p>Note also, “my daughter” is used by Clint, taking possession of Hailey, while Adkins used the word “that”, which indicates distance, and “child” which is associated with risk. </p>
<p>Now compare to one of  Justin DiPietro’s statements… <a href="http://www.kjonline.com/news/where-is-my-daughter__2012-03-29.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kjonline.com/news/where-is-my-daughter__2012-03-29.html</a></p>
<p>“It is a fact that her blood was found in my house. Yes, it is a fact that she broke her arm in my house. But, it is not a fact that any of it was intentional.<br>
“My daughter did not come to her demise down in my house. Nothing bad ever happened to my daughter in my house. She never got anything but love from the people in this house,” he said.</p>
<p>There is a saying Peter uses – If he can’t say it, we can’t say it for him.  What that means is we are not allowed to interpret, to say “well, what he meant was…”  We are only allowed to use the words he speaks.  There has never been a reliable denial from Justin.  He has never said simply and clearly  “I did not kill Ayla” or even “I did not cause Ayla’s disappearance”. </p>
<p>This article below is also a good article to read to pick up the difference in unreliable vs. deceptive.  It is mainly about Tiffany Hartley (David Hartley murder) but it gives good examples of why some statements are seen as unreliable and some are seen as deceptive. </p>

		<p>“It is a fact that her blood was found <strong>in my house.</strong> Yes, it is a fact that she broke her arm <strong>in my house.</strong> But, it is not a fact that any of it was intentional.<br>
“My daughter did not come to her demise <em>down </em><strong>in my house</strong>. Nothing bad ever happened to my daughter <strong>in my house.</strong> She never got anything but love from the people <strong>in this house,</strong>” he said.</p>
<p>Why the deviation from form “in my house” to “in this house”, and “down in my house”?</p>

		<p>IMO, the deviation is due to him considering another location to be “in my house” and it is the people “in this house” that gave nothing but love.</p>
<p>I mean that he could still consider Portland where “my house” is located and Ayla got only love in his mothers Waterville house. I do not know if this is SA or just parallel lying but I notice the changed in form as well and referred to it as parallel lying. Maybe I am wrong though?</p>

		<p>The parallel lye is further expanded upon when he says, “Nothing bad ever happened to my daughter in my house.” It happened in this house, not my house, right?</p>

		<p>IMO he was talking about Phoebe’s house when he said “in my house”, he was talking about the basement when he said “Ayla did not come to her demise down in my house” and he was implying that Ayla got something other than love at Trista’s house when he said “in this house”.</p>

		<p>its not his house, its his mom’s house…so he can claim none of that happened in HIS house, because it is not HIS house…<br>
if she were removed from the basement before she died, than he could tell himself this was also not true since she expired elsewhere, where ever he put her(sorry everyone, but I am beyond mincing words), and that nothing bad happened in HIS house, but might have in his mom’s house….<br>
using this as a baseline, his last statement indicates one of two choices…it either carries the most or the least sensitivity of the entire statement…</p>
<p>I think this is because in this one statement he can not convince himself of the truth no matter which angle he uses…and thus the reality change…</p>
<p>by considering the house his mother’s house during all events bad and nasty, he can say they did not happen in HIS house, and so can tell himself and LE/media he is telling the truth….this pattern of MY HOUSE also equates with the only likely truthful parts of his statement, which was that her blood and broken arm occured in MY HOUSE, and the huge red flag BUT…right before his claim on intention, which weakens “none of it was intentional” considerably…<br>
by saying THIS HOUSE, he gives away his internal reality change, that Ayla was not given only love in the house as he said, but other things as well, like a pulled grion muscle, a black eye form a ball pit that does not exist, and blood loss leading LE to believe she is dead…she likely got sporadic abuse, and a fatal injury, in THIS HOUSE…which is now, coincidentally, in his statement, everyone in the family’s house, not just his anymore, not his mom’s, this house spreads the blame out like jelly on toast</p>

		<p>Yes, Emerald, excellent.<br>
This reminds me of someone I know who has a huge ego, yet has low self esteem if you can imagin that, and is very controlling.  He moved in with his very succesfull girlfriend with a lovely home and immediately refered to her house as, “my house”, rather than saying, “her house” or, “our house”. His chin would jut out and his chest pumped up every time he talked about, “his house”.<br>
Was this a way of justin building himself , or trying to make himself look bigger and better thinking he would look less guilty?</p>

		<p>Excellent analysis Emerald. It places alot of my own misconceptions into place. I can see how the statement shows both a sensesitivity and a sign of deception as well. With that explanation, I think I am understanding alot more.</p>

		<p>That was a great analysis Emerald. </p>
<p>From the Statement Analysis blog…<br>
“Needless words are those that can be removed from a sentence with the sentence still being a complete sentence.  A needless word, according to the law of economy, is to be deemed “doubly important” to the analysis.  When an entire sentence is “unnecessary”, we are looking at something very important.”</p>
<p> This statement sticks out to me…<br>
“She never got anything but love from the people in this house,” he said.”<br>
 It’s a sentence stated in the negative which makes it sensitive to begin with. I also consider it an unnecessary statement.  You would expect a child living in the house to get love from the people living there, why the need to state what is expected.  Is he saying she never got love in that house?</p>

		<p>Thank you Dee, I was under the impression the negatively stated statements were signs of deception, and not signs of sensitivty. I understand now that this statement does show a sensitivity, but not neccessarily deception. But what about the statement is the sensitivity? Is it love shown by the people in the house or the people in the house itself that is the sensitivity?</p>

		<p>Nope, you got it right.  So, since, therefore, because, etc.also show a need to explain.  We need to ask why the person has a need to explain their actions.  Answering a question with a question is highlighted for sensitivity also.  This is from one of Peter’s articles…Q. Did you smoke pot while on duty?   A. Me? I never smoke pot.<br>
It’s a simple yes or no question that was not answered that way.<br>
Further questioning is needed to see why that question was sensitive – did they take pills while on duty or drink while on duty? Do they smoke pot, but not while on duty?</p>
<p>Also highlight where the word “left” is used.  When someone uses the word “left” (I left work and went to the store) it’s often the most sensitive part of the statement.</p>

		<p>Dee or Emerald, care to SA this statement from Justin? Notice the mix of present and past tense and another sentence starting with “and”.</p>
<p>In October 2011, DiPietro’s role expanded further while Reynolds prepared to enter rehabilitation for alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>“That’s when it really hit me that I could be doing a lot more for my daughter than I am doing. And I had the opportunity to, so why wouldn’t I?” he said.</p>

		<p>More statements from Justin with sentences starting with “and”. More missing information?</p>
<p>“When the time is right, everything is going to come out. <strong>And</strong> regardless of what law enforcement is saying or what (Ayla’s mother) Trista (Reynolds) is saying, this really isn’t the time to be saying anything. <strong>And </strong>law enforcement, they can say ‘We don’t believe they’re telling the truth,’ but there’s a big difference between fact and thinking something.”</p>

This statement is loaded even from a non SA point. He should have been doing more for Ayla before that, he had the opportunity before that. suddenly while Trista is going to be be tucked away he comes up with a plan, an opportunity?  Why would’nt he?    Why WOULD he?  SUDDENLY, Ayla is gone and he has the opportunity to speak for her and does not.  Why would’nt he?  Why would he?</p>

		<p>sure but is a bit long, sorry :<br>
“It was a really humbling experience,” DiPietro said of his first encounter with Ayla. “She looked exactly like me. There was no denying that she was my child.”<br>
He is being truthful here, as he never shifts tense, never adds extra info,  no but, no weakening statements in there…This is his baseline.<br>
“That’s when it really hit me that I could be doing a lot more for my daughter than I am doing. And I had the opportunity to, so why wouldn’t I?” he said.<br>
- That’s when it really hit me”–…he knew he was slacking as a father before that moment, but claims this as his moment of clarity…the addition of “really” weakens his assertion that he was unaware of his moral and legal obligations to Ayla prior to TRISTA FILING FOR CUSTODIAL RIGHTS AND SUPPORT A DAY EARLIER and going to rehab. This is connected to his last sentence, a question of us , the recipients, on his motives for taking Ayla…another huge red flag, because he asks the reader to guess his intent, and never secures his intent concretely…<br>
Justin  will not commit to the statement because he does not believe it…it is not true, and he can not say it, so asks the reader to do it for him…</p>
<p>“That’s when it really hit me that I could be doing a lot more for my daughter than I am doing. And I had the opportunity to, so why wouldn’t I?” he said.</p>
<p>He again weakens his statement by saying COULD BE(present tense, and non-committal when in context with responsibilities) , and by using BE instead of HAVE BEEN, instead of “should have been”, implying he then understood he had been forsaking a legal and moral responsibility…<br>
could be implies that he saw parenting responsibility as a volunteer opportunity, not a legal requirement, so just “realized” he was morally off by not supporting her, no mention of legal responsibility, or how Trista had all the responsibility alone while he was “unaware” or his duty as a father….</p>
<p>he also uses “my daughter” , which is very distant from “her” or Ayla”…and at the same time , switches to  present tense, which is strange, because he was referencing a past memory for only that part–” that I could be doing a lot more for my daughter than I am doing” , then switches back to past tense again…this last part is not in the present tense, because it was not included in his memory…he is asking it of us, because he wants the reader to fill the answer in for him….</p>
<p> AND is also extra info, a marker of deception or sensitivity…<br>
what is sensitive? his “opportunity” to parent…what  opportunity arose suddenly for him to parent which was not there before? Trista going to rehab…and this is sensitive because it is a poor excuse to become a caring parent all of the sudden, when no care or consideration was give before, legally or morally, by his own admission two sentences before…</p>
<p>“…SO WHY WOULDN’T I? The most sensitive part of the entire statement, as it ends in an open-ended query, that all decent people will fill in with something decent… “because it’s the right thing to do” or “because you love her…”, not  “under threat of penalty, revocation of driver’s licence, etc…” or  “to hurt her mother Trista” or even “to avoid child support, medical support, and to get a tax break and public assistance”… He will not say it himself, and we will not say it for him…<br>
his parenting skills and his motive for taking her is the sensitive issue, as it was not about love: within a short time of acquiring Ayla, he did try to claim her as a dependent for the whole year on his taxes, though she neither lived with him, nor received more that 50% of her support from him…this is tax fraud. He also bought an LIP against her…what a great plan to improve your parenting skills…no wonder this si such a sensitive topic for him…his motives were not pure, and his actions prove it.</p>

		<p>Wouldn’t “a lot” also be considered added words or unneccessary words? I could be doing more for Ayla! That would have been a complete sentence, so he knew that he was not doing for Ayla prior to and it became a sensitivity?</p>

		<p>Justin DiPietro said he was unaware of the fight.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see anything that happened,” he said. “We didn’t discuss what had happened.”</p>
<p>DiPietro said he didn’t learn about the incident until police questioned him at home. He added he was upset with his older brother.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the situation that I’m in, it’s not going to help anything by him going out and doing that,” he said.</p>

<p>***Just because Justin didn’t see what happened doesn’t mean he didn’t know what happened. They didn’t discuss what *had* happened, did they discuss what *would* happen before it did?</p>

		<p>Why is it that every statement he makes seems to center around himself. Once again “The situation that I’m in”. What about the situation Ayla is in? What is the situation you are in? Were you told you were a suspect, making it now your situation rather than Ayla’s?</p>

		<p>Linnell told the judge he had received a phone call and text messages earlier that day, Feb. 6, which he believed came from Lance DiPietro or Ayla’s father, Justin DiPietro, asking to meet with him. At the time, he was involved in a custody dispute over his daughter whose mother is Lance and Justin DiPietro’s sister, Elisha.</p>
<p>“<strong>I</strong> got calls from Justin that day,” Linnell told the judge. “Then <strong>I</strong> got texts. <strong>I </strong>refused to fight him twice. Him and his brother pretty much hunted me down. <strong>I</strong> didn’t see them coming until they stepped out of acar.”</p>
<p>The Waterville police report said Justin DiPietro did not leave the car, and he was not charged.<br>
Linnell said Lance DiPietro had a wooden mini-bat, but dropped it before the assault began in a parking lot on College Avenue in Waterville.</p>
<p><strong>“I</strong> told him to leave me alone,” Linnell said, adding that he feared any trouble would jeopardize his chances of having contact with his daughter. A protection from abuse order banned Linnell from seeing her, according to court records.</p>
<p>Linnell said he had Lance DiPietro in a headlock when “he picked me up and slammed me to the ground.”</p>
<p>Linnell said the assault stopped after he was kicked in the head. Linnell called police to report the attack and refused medical treatment at the time.</p>
<p>Linnell said the dispute was based on a mix of things, including his relationship with Elisha DiPietro and his comments about the disappearance of Ayla Reynolds, Justin DiPietro’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Lance DiPietro’s attorney, David Geller, said Linnell had posted a comment on Facebook indicating he believed Justin DiPietro had something to do with Ayla’s disappearance from her father’s home on Dec. 17.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/Lance-DiPietro-guilty-of-assault.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/Lance-DiPietro-guilty-of-assault.html</a></p>
<p>Notice in JL’s statement he uses “I” first person singular. He uses unnecessary words “pretty much” hunted me down, but IMO he was telling the truth about the calls and texts. If this is what happens when someone accuses the DiPietros of being involved in Ayla’s disappearance is it any wonder no one local spoke up and claimed the reward?</p>

		<p>John,<br>
this is because Justin is #1 to Justin, and so the situation is not about Ayla, but about the most important thing to him…himself.<br>
 This is why he never considered before his “moment of clarity” that he not only could but SHOULD have been doing something more the entire time, not just before Trista started having issues…he was only concerned with his own life, and not the other little lives he had already created…even the unwilling know they have a responsibility, and he knew there is a such thing as child support before he even created a child…so he is lying, as he knew he had a legal obligation…no moment of clarity, just a moment of shame…and thus the “situation” is HIS, he is in it, not Ayla…he left her “situation” behind a long time ago…like at the candle light vigil</p>

		<p>Mama, I thought it was reported that the “beatdown” was resulting from the custody dispute and nothing else? When did lances lawyer talk about the FB post? It definately explains why the judge told Lance”you are not your brothers keeper” but it definately does not explain why it was so lightly handled.</p>

		<p>Justin took his opportunity to get out of child support payments rather than for doing the right thing IMO.<br>
Has he done the right thing by his other child?  Did he have no need of an, “opportunity” to get out of  child support payments .  I don’t know if he was paying anything but what I have heard was that he was not paying.  He has had no need to take any opportunity to do the , “right thing”. So when will his moment of clarity come for his other child, When he figures out that he could be doing alot more?  When and if he is ordered to pay child support?  I wonder if he has willingly paid any child support.</p>

		<p>It sounds like $300.00 is the magic number for assault. Someone I know pushed his way into a home and choked the father of the household, and his fine was $300.00.  I consider that to be not much of a penalty for violence.</p>

		<p>Not much of a penalty for violence at all. The worst part is the court was asked to force Lance to pay restitution for medical bills totalling $700 and the court refused to order it?  WHY???</p>

		<p>No John it is not much of a penalty and I think he should have been made to pay the medical bill.  What kind of a message is this sending?  How about $1000.00?  That would hurt a bit more, and some jail time.  That may make someone think twice before attaching someone.</p>

		<p>That it would Chicky, increased fines, mandatory restitution and mandatory jail time.

		<p>I was going by this article Margy but maybe his birthday was yesterday and not today? Either way. Happy Birthday Lil Ray.</p>
<p>Francis called Ron Reynolds and Trista Reynolds, Ayla’s mother, at 2 p.m. Saturday from the VFW hall.</p>
<p>The 60 or so people at the VFW cheered for the toddler and shouted happy birthday to Trista Reynolds’ son, Raymond Fortier, who turned 1 Saturday.</p>
<p>On a speaker phone, Ron Reynolds said he wished he could be in Fairfield but the family was celebrating Ray’s special day in Portland.</p>

		<p>Toddler’s father says he took a polygraph exam 1/14/12<br>
Asked if other family members had taken a polygraph exam, DiPietro said he was not sure.</p>
<p>“I just know about myself,” he said. “Again, anything (police have) asked us to do, we’ve cooperated. We’ve made ourselves available to them.</p>
<p>“Anytime they’ve had a question about something, if they want us to come to the station … more than willing. We’re cooperating. There’s nothing to hide here.”</p>
<p>The dropped pronoun before stating “more than willing” is very odd on multiple levels. I understand with SA there is missing info that we can not insert for the speaker. But I also notice that Justin goes from “not sure” to explaining how cooperative they have all been. I get the impression he wanted to place emphasis on thier cooperation, but was avoiding the Polygraphs and the Polygraph results?</p>

		<p>If Justin can’t say “We’re more than willing”, we can’t say it for him. I agree John, he was trying to avoid discussing the polys. I find it hard to believe that he didn’t know if anyone else took polys.</p>

		<p>I also find it hard to believe that he would not know exactly how each of them did on the Polys as well. If, as McCausland said they all took Polys, then we can safely assume that they have discussed the results amongst each other. Especially if as Heidi leads us to believe, Justin discussed the results with her, why would he not have discussed the results with all that took Polys?</p>

		<p>“I asked for a polygraph on day one,” DiPietro said Friday during an interview with the Morning Sentinel. “I’ve taken one, and the results, I was never allowed to see them. It’s something you’re going to have to ask law enforcement about.”</p>
<p>DiPietro, 24, was told how he did on the test, Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said. He said he was baffled by DiPietro’s statement that he didn’t know the results.</p>
<p>“He knows how he did, because we told him,” McCausland said. “To say that he didn’t know, is just not true.”</p>
<p>McCausland would not say how DiPietro did. “That is something I can’t get into,” he said.</p>
<p>DiPietro said, “I know I went in there and smoked it. I told the truth and that’s that.”</p>
<p>When asked if police told him the results, DiPietro said. “They can tell me whatever they want. Again, I didn’t physically see the results.”</p>
<p>When asked if police told him he failed the test, DiPietro said, “That’s all irrelevant. I wanted to see the results myself. They’re not letting me see them. Why don’t they let the public see them?”</p>

<p>*** Why not simply say, “I took a polgraph test and I passed.”? It was easier to use all these additional words than to lie. JMO.</p>

		<p>When asked if police told him he failed the test, DiPietro said, “That’s all irrelevant.”</p>
<p> if failing results are irrelevant, then why the need to see the results in person, if you passed…</p>
<p>“They can tell me whatever they want. Again, I didn’t physically see the results.”</p>
<p>No one in their right mind would question PASSING a polygraph, only FAILING one, unless they were trying to say to LE that they should not have passed it, and LE made a mistake…but that would be tantamount to admitting guilt….<br>
 So he is questioning the validity of the polygraph, because LE told him he failed…</p>

		<p>I agree too Chicky, as Emerald says Justin told us all that LE told him he had failed the poly and that is the bottom line truth. Not the fictious belief that LE is going to show every examinee the physical results. Not too many people are wualified to read the results anyways, so what good would it have been to show him the results.</p>

		<p>he indicate he failed them by saying the results LE told him are irrelevant…if he passed it wouldnot be irrelevant, nor would he care to see the answeres to verify he passed… and LE told him he failed his poly, but he will not accept that he failed them until he is allowed to see the results physically…what a jerk<br>
very typical behavior of the guilty as well …if he can’t say it for him self, well, we can not say it for him, but the Derek, Heidi and Angela will…</p>

		<p>Elisha DiPietro, 23, is one of three adults who were in the 29 Violette Avenue home on Dec. 17, the morning Ayla was reported missing. She addressed the polygraph exam Saturday during the Eyes Open Walk for Baby Ayla, an event to raise awareness about the toddler’s disappearance. DiPietro also shared her family’s contention that a two-week forensic investigation of Ayla’s home may have overlooked some details.</p>
<p>“They did administer a polygraph,” DiPietro said. “I took it. I did fine.”</p>
<p>When DiPietro was asked to clarify whether she passed or failed the exam, DiPietro repeated her initial statement, adding that she’s not concerned how her response will be received by the public.</p>
<p>“I mean, I did fine. It’s what it is. People are going to take things how they take them, and they’re going to call us liars, if they want to call us liars, but I know the truth, and we know the truth, and we know we didn’t do anything wrong. We want Ayla home. We love Ayla.”</p>

<p>*** Why not simply say, “I took a polgraph test and I passed.”? It was easier to use all these additional words than to lie. JMO. Birds of a feather?</p>

		<p>Exactly MM.  They both failed imo.  Think about how you would react.  If I was a parent of a missing child (God forbid) the first thing I would do is ask for a poly to get the suspicion off myself and get the investigation focused where it needs to be.  I would be in LE’s face telling them “I passed.  I’m telling you the truth. Now help me find my kid!”  If asked by a journalist I would say “I took a polygraph and passed it”.  No extra words are necessary. Not “I smoked it” or “I did fine”. Certainly not “They wouldn’t show me the results”. Those are all statements to deflect, persuade and bring attention away from the failing of the poly.</p>

<p>Again if she can’t say it either, then we can’t say it for her. I agree with both you and Dee, Mama. They both failed the exam and as Dee said, if any of us took and passed, our resulting action would be to say ““I passed. I’m telling you the truth. Now help me find my kid!”” Instead they both went silent shortly after thier “I smoked it” and “I did fine” comments.</p>

		<p>To this I say : Elisha likely passed overall, passed the questions addressing Ayla’s injury that caused her to bleed in the house, passed the questions about knowledge of her removal from the home, and of the clean up of the blood evidence (well, some of it, obviously no one cleaned up the blood spots, which are separate from what was found by the bed), but likely did not pass some questions, like about what her brother did all day, what he said and was doing when she got home that DAY, what happened that evening, and if this was last time she saw Ayla, and what was going on in the morning during the search…</p>
<p>I think that by saying “I did fine.” she can tell herself that passing most of the questions is like getting a B on a test(after all a poly is a test), and so you did fine, even good with a B(a B is 80% correct…), and this is passing, even though you failed a few questions…this is what “fine” means…</p>

		<p>notice he also never states HE gave her love…only “the people in this house”… not HIS house…everything in the entire paragraph was about him, until the last sentence, which he may or may not be included, by his own words…if he can’t say it himself, there is a reason…because it does not correlate with the internal reality of his mind, his thoughts and beliefs up there in his head…it differs from what he knows to really be true and so it is stressful to say, so he avoids the stress by avoiding the stimulus of the stress…the facts in full, with nothing left out or changed…commonly referred to as “the truth”, but I prefer fact or empirical evidence, cause truth is slightly subjective, depending on viewpoint…this is why an individual can tell themselves, convince their conscious mind the something is true, when it is not…</p>

		<p>I just noticed this comment Emerald. When you mention “notice he also never states HE gave her love…only “the people in this house”… not HIS house…” it is very much him saying thos in this house but he clearly seperates his house and this house. Is he saying he did not show her nothing but love?</p>

		<p>“Obviously, the situation that I’m in, it’s not going to help anything by him going out and doing that,” he said.</p>
<p>In Justin’s world, everything is always about himself. “The situation” is obviously about his being under suspicion in his daughter’s disappearance. If it was simply about Ayla being abducted by a Violette Ave. stalking pervert, Justin would not be worrying about how he looked under any circumstance, including his brother’s criminal behavior..</p>
<p>What about his daughter’s “situation”?  He has never expressed any worry over that. Ayla is supposed to be in the hands of a kidnapper. Yet, he never, at least publicly, underscores the tragedy by showing concern for her well-being in the captivity of a criminal or possible insane person.</p>
<p>Past all that, Justin drove his brother Lance to his beat down with Justin Linnell, yet he expects everyone to believe that he saw nothing, and didn’t talk with Lance about what happened. Here is a person who has probably lied for years about many things and gotten away with it. </p>
<p>Most people either pretended to believe what he said or didn’t care enough to provoke him into anger by correcting him. Until he ran into unexpected resistance from LE.. and the public from his nonsensical statements. What a shock!</p>

		<p>JD we’re looking at how the FBI and different LE agencies use SA during investigations and interrogations. We looked at statements that have been made and how to analyze them going by instructions by the FBI. </p>
<p>As far as Clint Dunn, he is like a zombie due to his years of drug use. There were no sensitivity indicators in his statement and he used first person singular, past tense in his denial, making it a reliable denial. It isn’t just the fact that there were no sensitivity indicators that makes it a reliable denial.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you why there are sensitivity indicators in Trista’s statements when I don’t know which statements you’re referring to. The rules of SA apply to all statements the same way. The same for Trista as Justin.</p>

		<p>I would also add that sensitivity indicators are not always indicators of deception either. Trista has lost a child that she thought was safe with Justin. There will be sensivities to a mother in this situation under every normal condition. Just mentioning Ayla’s name could trigger a crying outbreak, that would be a sensitivity of a normal mother feeling the grief of having a missing child.</p>

		<p>We know that Trista still blames herself for needing to go to rehab in the first place. The guilt she feels can cause sensitivity indicators too.</p>

		<p>That’s bullshit if you read Peters site at all you would know that innocent parents dont show deception indicators. If you want examples of tristas sensitivity just go to graces site she has plenty. Feeling guilty about what happened before the disappearance doed not translate to sensitivity indicators afterwards. Trista used drugs and alcohol so why isn’t she numb? If you use that logic then justins lack of emotion could be due to his drug use and not due to his guilt. If you take a close look at the issues Trista shows sensitivity to, you will see it is not due to her guilt over losing Ayla but about the topic at hand, indicating deception. Why won’t Trista let Peter interview her and take questions like Elaine Redwine?</p>

		<p>JD you are WRONG! You need to go read at Peter’s site about the differences between sensitivity indicators and deceptive indicators! You want us to SA one of Trista’s statements? C&amp;P it here. I won’t go hunting them for you. </p>
<p>You can not compare Clint and Trista’s drug use as an example JD. Trista lived many miles away and was trying to get DHHS to help her to get Ayla back. Clint lived next door and knew his daughter was scared of her mom’s boyfriend. His daughter begged him to let her live with him but he was too doped up to do anything or help her.</p>

		<p>That’s your opinion JD. LE has said all along that Trista is cooperating. They have never said she is withholding information. Maybe you need to come clean and explain your reasons for trying to paint Trista in a bad light?</p>

		<p>I have a problem with the fact that Trista had lied and never come out and said why she lied or what the truth is. Instead she sends Jeff. Innocent parents don’t need to lie about anything. If she lies to the media to suit her purpose, how do we know she is being honest with the police. LE will often say suspects are cooperating, right up until they are arrested.</p>

		<p>JD you are making accusations and stating it as fact yet you won’t show proof of these accusations. You are entitled to your opinions of Trista but I can’t answer you as to why she says something when you won’t tell us what she said. I agree that LE does sometimes says a person is cooperating up until they make an arrest but LE has implied that Justin is not. They haven’t done that with Trista.</p>

		<p>I looked through the statement analysis sites I know of and don’t find any articles showing deception in Trista’s statements.  The following I found on Peter Hyatt’s site:<br>
Mother Blames Self for Baby Ayla<br>
Trista Reynolds blamed herself, saying if it were not for her addiction, Ayla never would have been in Waterville, subject to the bloodshed that took place in Phoebe DiPietro’s basement, at the hands of Ayla’s father, Justin DiPietro. </p>
<p>Parents are always ultimately responsible, but it should be remembered always that it was not her hands that bruised, battered, and eventually took the life of Baby Ayla. </p>
<p>Maine prosecutors should carefully consider the work done elsewhere, where successful murder prosecution has taken place, without the child’s body being found. </p>
<p>Ayla Reynolds was reported “missing” by her father, a mere 6 weeks after the single, unemployed father bought a life insurance against Ayla’s life, profiting off of her death.  He telegraphed his plans, via text messages of ‘concern of kidnapping’ to Trista Reynolds in the interim.  </p>
<p>Police officially state that DiPietro, his sister, Elisha DiPietro, and his girlfriend, Courtney Roberts, have, in concert, all lied about what took place that night.  </p>
<p>The grandmother deceived media when she said she “heard nothing” that night, only to later admit she was not in the home, highlighting the very need she had to be deceptive to protect her son.</p>

		<p>JD “If Trista wants her baby girl home she needs to come clean and start telling the truth about what happened before she disappeared.” </p>
<p>How will Tristas drug/alcohol addiction prior to Ayla’s disappearance from 29 Violette Ave on the morning of 17 Dec, shortly before sunrise, bring AYla home? How will it explain Ayla’s blood in the basement at that house? How will it explain Ayla’s blood being cleaned-up before LE arriving on that morning? And how will it explain the lies, failed polys, diversions and distractions of those that were at that house on that night/morning? You know what, don’t bother answering any of these questions as it is obvious to most, you simply want an arguement and I am done arguing with you. Hove a nice day JD.</p>

		<p>Thank you Kimc. Here is a comment from Peter on that article.</p>
<p>Seamus O Riley said …</p>
<p>Feed a cold, starve a troll. </p>
<p>Don’t respond to nonsense where the anonymous poster merely wants attention, even negative attention, at the cost of decency. </p>
<p>Regarding Trista: her life was a mess and she took ownership of her own actions which led to allowing a monster to take care of Ayla. </p>
<p>Her pain will never end, though I pray it is alleviated as she is busy with her son, and rebuilding her life. </p>
<p>She is also a victim of DiPietro violence and deception. </p>

		<p>jd said…”If you want examples of tristas sensitivity just go to graces site she has plenty.”</p>
<p>Well, there ya have it…. “just go to Grace’s site”. That comment should tell you everything you need to know about jd.  IMO, Grace picks and chooses how to apply SA to statements.  She gets sensitivity indicators and deception all mixed up. She’s not interested in learning and getting it right, she’s interested in how to make statements fit into her vast conspiracy theory.</p>

		<p>Hick, we didn’t bring Grace up, you and JD did. If you know Grace can’t come here to defend herself, why try to bring attention to her sites? You seem to be here to defend Grace so what are you worried about? All I see is an attempt to draw attention to Grace and away from Ayla.</p>

		<p>OK.  This whole topic needs to be shut down, this WAS all about Grace today.  Grace posted over on Tori’s J4A blog whining about being picked on here and how she’s blocked from not only commenting here but reading here. (Commenting I understand but how do you block someone from reading a blog on the www unless it’s a private, members only one?)<br>
Hickory, why are you being Grace’s lackey?  There was a time you’d come here and have some good civil discussions.  Now it seems it doesn’t have anything to do with<br>
Ayla, it’s only to get people’s blood pressure up and cause problems.  I won’t comment further on the topic, I just wanted to make this one last comment because it<br>
pissed me off<br>
off.</p>

		<p>Thank you Dee I agree. There is no way for me to block anyone from viewing this site. Grace has not tried to comment or it would be in spam with all the other sites and spam I have blocked. I am sure no-one wants to see porn and free med sites all day. Anyways, what Grace claimed is not accurate, she has been blocked, but her comments would go to spam and she would still be able to read the site. I can also tell you that Mama and I are done with Grace today. Thank you for kicking us in the butt with your reminder. Back to Ayla’s case!</p>

		<p>Oh and mama you brought up Hailey begging her father. Ayla had to be pulled away from Jessica to be handed over to Justin. Do you think she just smiled and waved bye-bye to Trista when they saw each other at the dr. visits? I bet Ayla cried and hung on to her mom, yet Trista walked away. Three times.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to paint Trista in a bad light. she did that all on her own.</p>

		<p>Trista tried to bring Ayla home with her after at least one of the doctor visits.  Justin refused to let her.  I bet Ayla was crying and clinging to her mom – which makes this whole tragedy all the worse and makes Justin look more like a heartless monster.</p>

		<p>Im not talking about her use.</p>
<p>Why did Trista say that she and Justin had an agreement about Ayla only to say laterthat he stole her thru dhs?? </p>
<p>What did she originally tell police and which is the truth? I think this is directly related to Ayla and why she disappeared. Keep in mind she lied after rehab not before so you can’t blame the drugs for her fogginess.</p>

		<p>The police have never stated Trista has lied about anything.  They have stated numerous times Justin, his sister and his girlfriend are lying.</p>

		<p>The police don’t have to say it. It’s all out there in the media. Girst she said they had no relationship outside of parenting Ayla, then she had Jeff leak on this very blog that she’d been sleeping with Justin. why did she lie? What did she tell LE and what is the truth?</p>

		<p>If you state one of her statements is accurate how can you then ignor another. She stated that she an agreement with Justin before rehab, and she stated there was and agreement with Justin to have Ayla visit during rehab and Ayla to be returned to Trista immediately following rehab, with DHHS to re-enforce that agreement. DHHS did not enforce anything, AYla was not brought for the visit, Ayla was not returned the day after, and DHHS blew of Trista on all attempts to get them to help her. If that is not Justin stealing Ayla with the help of DHHS, what would you call it.</p>

		<p>If Trista has filed a civil suit against DHHS she is not going to discuss it on a blog or anywhere else for that matter. DHHS won’t say anything either.</p>

		<p>Here’s a good question, why did Trista change her story from never seeing Ayla again after entering rehab to seeing her twice at Dr visits and once in Waterville? Keep in mind three is the liars number. Which is true and what did she tell le?</p>

		<p>First off I am pointing out you are chosing certain comments to believe and others not to believe. I don’t think that is fair to show a person lying, do you? Secondly, from the day Trista posted the timeline she has maintained the last time she saw Ayla. That I can remember she only said she had not spoken to Ayla since the 8th of Dec and not seen Ayla from IIRC 21 Nov. I do not know where you got that she ever stated she never saw Ayla since rehab???</p>
<p>If you want to talk about her saying she had no relationship other than joint parenting but yet let it out later that she was sleeping with him. Well again, IIRC it was Derek that said it was a one night stand only, not Trista, and it was Trista that defended Justin early on before finding out Ayla’s blood was spilled in his basement. We have different recollections of the facts JD, I may be wrong but I have screenshots, posts and a timeline to back up what I recall. If you can show me something from before that, I will gladly read it over.</p>

		<p>Trista did an interview on bdn early on where she said she didn’t see Ayla after she entered rehab. The link is on this site. I am not picking what to believe. if she did see Ayla zt the drs visits then she lied in her interview. Why?</p>

		<p>jd says “Ayla had to be pulled away from Jessica to be handed over to Justin.”<br>
A loving father would have seen that his daughter was happy where she was and known she was better off staying with someone she loved and was bonded with.  Ayla hardly knew Justin.  It was cruel for him to have taken her in the first place.</p>

		<p>People with common sense know that questions about Trista are pointless and cruel.  She, and everyone else knows her faults and mistakes.  Because she has faults and has made mistakes doesn’t make it ok to have had her daughter murdered while with her father.  It doesn’t make it ok for vicious bloggers to lay the blame on her when Ayla was with Justin when she met her demise.</p>

April 2, 2013 at 10:12 am  (Edit)<br>
If Trista wants her baby girl home she needs to come clean and start telling the truth about what happened before she disappeared.</p>
<p>You definately laid blame with this comment. As Mama said, you are pulling everything you can out of a hat and still have not produced the comment for SA which is what started this whole thing this morning. I second Mama’s comment, there is no point in continuing the conversation.</p>

		<p>JD this is what was said. The sexual relationship ended before Trista went into rehab. Why would Trista say they were still having a relationship on Nancy Grace 2 months after it had ended? That would be a lie. If you have time to keep commenting, you have time to do your own research, I’m done.</p>

John P!, I think I misunderstood your question. The last time Trista made love with Justin was one week before she entered rehab. So before.</p>

		<p>Andy, I will say Wordman is someone who knows Trista very well and it will have to stay at that. You have to take it for what it is worth because nothing more will be said in regards to who is Wordman.</p>

		<p>It is a waste of time dissecting Trista’s statements both real and the imaginary ones you’re coming up with.  Trista is a victim of the heartless criminals that disposed of her daughter.</p>

		<p>LE has had no problem at all saying no abduction occured, those in house are not telling all they know, Aylas blood in the basement was more than a small cut could produce, and Trista has been cooperating throughout the investigation. Add all this together KIMC and I think we have an answer!</p>

		<p>I’m not forgetting KIMC! We all know there is no agenda for LE to “frame” JD even though there are some that say he is being framed, and LE has enough common sense to not let out too much to compromise the case. This is a definate KIMC!</p>

		<p>JD says :  “If she can Facebook she can blog. She chooses not to. Why? Afraid to answer questions like mine? And you call Justin a coward? Does she want her baby back or not.”<br>
So you are saying if Trista BLOGS Ayla will reappear? This sounds close to blackmail.</p>
<p>April 2, 2013 at 10:12 am JD says:<br>
“If Trista wants her baby girl home she needs to come clean and start telling the truth about what happened before she disappeared.”<br>
This sounds close to blackmail.  JD, do you know something and will tell if Trista comes on this blog?</p>

<p>Give it up jd.  These idiots can’t see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what Trista does or doesn’t do. Ayla was lost on Justin’s watch, and that is all that matters.  They don’t care what she did before that, and what she may do now.</p>

		<p>I agree Hickory that Tristas history does not matter nor what she is doing today.  What matters is hearing the truth about where Ayla is and those from the dips house are the only ones responsible for what happened to Ayla.<br>
Tristas history, the same as mine, has nothing to do with Aylas disappearence.<br>
If it takes a bunch of, “idiots” to speak for Ayla rather than against Trista then I’m proud to be an idiot so thank you for that hickory</p>

		<p>I will try to share my thinking which might explain for JD<br>
If she was having an affair and cared for the Justin, and knew that he would face issues if the affair was to “come out” she very well may minimize the affair at first while still holding out hope that Ayla was just kidnapped    As evidence and LE statements came to light her loyalty probably crashed and she didn’t care if his family/ relationship was hurt.    i can also understand an interpretation of ‘ seeing my daughter’ as being able to physically take her home for a night or spend a few hours with…. i dont believe she was being deceptive, i believe the doctors appts were not thought of  as a visitation.  as in  he hasnt let me see my daughter since i got out of rehab, meaning a true visitation with Ayla alone.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the input Windstorm, your reasoning makes sense to me. Would you consider the visit to Phoebes house in the same light as the doctors office visit?</p>

		<p>I would say more an exaggeration,   Many people exaggerate things.   “I’ve called you 100 times”. We have been waiting forever.     Usually these exaggerations stem from frustrating situations.   We know she felt that Justin was keeping Ayla from her and was not allowing calls.   I believe it was more of an exaggeration.  He won’t let me see my daughter.   I haven’t seen her since I got out of rehab.</p>

		<p>Some Justin defenders are either trolls, bi-polar, delusional or drunk. Now, lets ‘see the latest whine about no one here allowing them to ferment.</p>
<p>I wondered why the DiPietro forces at large have quieted down on their sites about Trista “taking Ayla.” It used to be their main fallback mantra.  Now, I see that the new line of defense here is a bit of a sidecar. A bit of a new approach outside the usual “Trista done it!”.</p>
<p>It seems LE in all these months have not been able to track Ayla’s hiding place with Trista, not have the DiPietro mob and their enforcers found the child in the lower 48 and Alaska with their billboards. (Cough).</p>
<p>So scrap that theory.  The new cannon of Holy Spit reads like this: “Trista has the power to bring Ayla back by confessing her (Trista’s) lies and lack of morality in her relationship with Justin.” As someone above said, this sounds highly sinister as if someone is about to reveal all as “the time is right”. Maybe it’s time, but Justin is not well cast for the part as an Avenging Angel. Why?</p>
<p>Justin and his gang that can’t shoot straight are overlooking AGAIN the place and people from whence Ayla went missing. To them, the facts are irrelevant. It’s the old shell game. How can we keep anybody from looking at Justin too closely?</p>
<p>Ah, here’s the ticket! Keep harping on Trista’s character being to blame for Ayla’s “disapperance”, and not what Justin or his crew probably did to cause Ayla’s actual “demise.”</p>
<p>After the Casey Anthony debacle, anything is possible with a jury, right? George got blamed for Caylee’s death. Casey walked free as a bird.</p>
<p>If Trista’s moral character can be ultimately put on trial for what happened to Ayla, then are we supposed to overlook a DiPietro likely “accident” with Ayla?</p>
<p> Not bloody likely!  But worth a try. Is somebody getting desperate?</p>

		<p>I do understand the frustration Penny. I have been and am still waiting for a reason to believe that Ayla was abducted. It seems each theory that is announced is ignoring the blood evidence, ignoring MSP (and LE in total) statements, ignoring the CLIP purchase 6 weeks prior and trying to say that someohow someone associated with Trista or her family kidnapped and hid Ayla for the past 15.5 months! I just want truthful answers, like everyone else, especially at this time. The “time has to be right”, because if not now, when?</p>

		<p>This constant deflection to Trista and away from where and with whom Ayla disappeared would be amusing if it weren’t so beside the  main point.</p>
<p>To me, it doesn’t matter if Trista lied about her relationship with Justin (maybe she was ashamed) but it does seem odd that the Trista deflectors are seemingly drumming up a relationship with Peachy which Justin, himself, denied through the voice of his personal romance novelist, Angela Harry.  In her saintly portrait of Justin’s “long-time, fast-track girlfriend”, Miz Courtney, AH specifically referenced Justin not having a relationship with Trista! That “no relationship” relationship might have been a real bummer to close-mouthed Miz Roberts. She might have been so indignant as to open her trap.</p>
<p>Ol’ Peachy would have had to be part of the Trista/Justin sexual equation, though, if he and Trista were getting it on, no? Or was poor pouty Peachy drugged, or in a state of bondage, when he cheated on his true love, Courtney, with a person like Trista so beneath him in intellect and class? </p>
<p>All that carp about when did Trista have sex with Justin, or when did she last see Ayla, does not matter,  Whatever “they” continue to say about Trista, it can never equal the slings, arrows, and digs leveled at Justin, Couurtney and Elisha by LE who continue to say that these three people, who last had care of Ayla in that house, are not telling all they know, are withholding information, and telling stories which do not pass “the straight-face test”. I interpret this last description to mean that their stories would be a big fat joke if a child were not missing with her blood showing up in the home..</p>
<p>LE has never said that Trista’s stories “do not pass the straight-face test”. When, LE starts knocking Trista, as they have Justin, Elisha and Courtney, about how Trista is withholding vital information and not cooperating, then I might pay attention to the Trista-whiners. Until LE gets on Trista’s back for not being forthcoming, I’ll not waste my time picking her life apart.</p>

		<p>Penny, when you said in your closing line “Until LE gets on Trista’s back for not being forthcoming, I’ll not waste my time picking her life apart.” I thought to myself, Amen, finally someone gets it. But then I realized, you have gotten it for a while now. Sadly there are many who do not understand that even though we now have so much more information to go off from.</p>

		<p>OT From this post but I felt I should not post this on Ayla’s birthday wishes post.</p>
<p>From this Online Sentinel Report for Aylas third birthday. A message from Steve McCausland.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/neighbors-remember-missing-girl_2013-04-03.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/neighbors-remember-missing-girl_2013-04-03.html</a></p>
<p>“The case continues to be open and active, but there are no new developments,” Steve McCausland, spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>He added: “Any birthday of a child is a milestone, usually filled with joy and hope. Today is a sad reminder this is not the case in Waterville, and that on Ayla’s third birthday we still do not have the complete story of what happened inside that Violette Avenue home from those who know what occurred. Ayla deserves better.”</p>
<p>I agree so much with McCausland, Ayla deserves better, much better, from those who know what occured inside that Violette Avenue house. Sorry I can not call it a home knowing what has happened in that house.</p>

		<p>Thank you for this John. My feelings of sadness and anger know no bounds today. I’m reluctant to comment on Ayla’s birthday post with all the negative thoughts going through my mind. Ayla deserves so much more…</p>

		<p>I am sorry to add to your anger and sadness Mama. Did you notice this part of the story that said;</p>
<p>A black car stood in the driveway, but no one answered the door, which was flanked on either side by stuffed garbage bags, Christmas lawn decorations and a child’s orange snow shovel hanging from a mailbox.</p>
<p>A shrine of teddy bears and other stuffed animals that for many months grew on the front lawn is gone, but a ‘No Trespassing’ sign still hangs from a big tree near the street.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the wind whacked away at the sign, making an eerie howling noise that alternated with the clang of a black metal wind chime perched near the house.</p>
<p>So Phoebe’s car was in the driveway, the reporter knocked on the door and yet no answers. The “no trespassing” sign is, I am guessing, strictly enforced at the Voilette Avenue house if they wont even answer the door on the eve of Ayla’s birthday. Or did they just forget that today was Ayla’s birthday like they are hoping everything else will be forgotten? Phoebe calls herself a grandmother, I would have to disagree strongly and call it something far different!</p>

		<p>I am reminded Mama, in this article, it talks about how the one neighbor brought LE a pot of coffee each night when Ayla was reported missing. I also recall last Christmas, the carollers being turned away from the DiPetro’s door as well with not so much as an offer of coffee or cocoa. There is not a holiday, a birthday, a monthly or annual mark recognized by any of the W3/4 in honor of Ayla! I would definately agree with your description of this house of horror!</p>

		<p>“I hope every night the wind blows wicked and the “No Trespassing” sign howls eerily all night long and wakes Elisha and Phoebe with fear”</p>
<p>I so agree Mama.  That was such a well written descriptive article.<br>
I also remember watching the carolers out in the cold and snowstorm trudging through the snow and if I lived closer they all would have gotten hot cocoa and snacks from me, and the dips did not even have the manners, kindness or appriciation to open the door and say thank you to the angels in front of their house who were singing their hearts out for little Ayla. Disgusting!</p>

		<p>Ridiculous that neighbors that didn’t know her can comment on how they still think of Ayla and their hope for her but not one member of her “family” can answer the door to make a comment for her birthday article.  Shameless.</p>

		<p>ITA Dee, there was even a neighbor who has had a lit Cristmas light in her window since Dec 17, 2011 and will not remove it until Ayla has recieved justice, and yet no answer at the door and the no trespass sign still up. Shameless indeed, and even that may be to polite a word to describe it.</p>

		<p>Good idea John. Today especially we are all filled with frustration and anger, we can vent over here rather than clutter Ayla’s Birthday Wishes post with our comments about this injustice.</p>

		<p>I certainly have my angry and frustrated days but today I am just sad. It was so kind of the neighbors to speak for Ayla and shows that there are good hearted, caring people in this world who have not pushed Ayla to the back of their minds and hearts.</p>

<p>Here is another link today that shows Trista &amp; MSP are frustrated and angry both. But this article shows specifically who they are frustrated and angry with when it says;</p>
<p>“The lack of answers and progress in finding her has been frustrating for Ayla’s family and investigators. State Police say they’re continuing to focus their search operations in and around this home. They say they will continue to do so until they find Ayla.”</p>
