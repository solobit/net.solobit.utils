Chris J Jackson's neuropsychological hybrid model of learning in personality argues
Sensation Seeking provides a core biological drive of curiosity, learning and exploration.
A high drive to explore leads to dysfunctional learning consequences unless cognitions
such as goal orientation, conscientiousness, deep learning and emotional intelligence
re-express it in more complex ways to achieve functional outcomes such as high work performance

The model aims to explain many forms of functional behaviour (such as entrepreneurial activity,
work performance, educational success) as well as dysfunctional behaviour (such as delinquency
and anti-social behaviour). The wide applicability of the model and its strong grounding in the
academic literature suggests that this evidence based model of learning has much potential.

Latest research is summarized here.[21] Evidence for this model is allegedly
impressive.[22][23][24][25][26][27] Siadaty and Taghiyareh (2007)[28] report
that training based on Conscientious Achievement increases performance
but that training based on Sensation Seeking does not.

These results strongly support Jackson's model since the model proposes that
Conscientious Achievement will respond to intervention whereas Sensation
Seeking (with its biological basis) will not.
