Cognitive approach to learning styles [edit]
Anthony Grasha and Sheryl Reichmann, in 1974, formulated the Grasha-Reichmann Learning Style Scale.
It was developed to analyze the attitudes of students and how they approach learning.
The test was originally designed for college students.
Grasha's background is in cognitive processes and coping techniques.

The concepts of various learning styles are as follows:
avoidant
participative
competitive
collaborative
dependent
independent

The conclusion of this model was to provide teachers with insight on how to approach instructional plans. [20]
Aiming to explain why aptitude tests, school grades, and classroom performance often fail to identify real ability,
Robert J. Sternberg listed various cognitive dimensions in his book Thinking Styles (1997). Several other models
are also often used when researching learning styles. This includes the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the DISC assessment.
