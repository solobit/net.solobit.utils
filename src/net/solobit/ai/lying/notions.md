# Nonverbal and Verbal Lie Detection

Different approaches share 3 things in common that have influinced verbal and non-verbal lie detection: the notion that, compared with truth tellers, liars:

(a) may experience stronger emotions (particularly fear, as a result of detection apprehension)
(b) may experience higher levels of cognitive load, and
(c) are inclined to use more and different strategies to make a convincing impression on others.

Traditionally, verb.&nonverb. detection was focussed on (a). Police manuals are prim. based on notion that liars are more concerned and nervous than TT
The approach has limitations.

1. experience emotions is not exclusive to liars (someone affraid not to be believed, shame etc.)
