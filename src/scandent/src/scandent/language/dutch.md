In syntax, verb-second (V2) word order is the most distinctive principle of word order in Germanic languages. The only exception here is English, which has predominantly SVO instead of V2 order, although certain vestiges of the V2 phenomenon can also be found in English.

The V2 principle requires that the finite verb (= inflected verb) appear in second position of a declarative main clause, whereby the first position is occupied by a single major constituent that functions as the clause topic.

## Finite and infinite verbs ~{werkwoorden}

A `finite verb` is **a form of a verb that:

* has a *subject* (expressed or implied) and;
* can *function as the root* of an `independent clause`

An independent clause can, in turn, *stand alone* as a `complete sentence`.

> Notation: in a sentence *finite verbs are in italic* and;
> **non-finite verbs are in bold**

> Verbs *appear* in almost all sentences.
> This sentence *is* **illustrating** finite and non-finite verbs.

In many languages, `finite verbs` are the locus of grammatical information of:

* gender
* person
* numbertense
* aspect
* mood
* voice

(Subject and finite verbs)
> (Verbs appear) in almost all sentences.
> (This sentence is illustrating) finite and non-finite verbs.
> (The dog will) have been trained well.
> (Tom promises) to try to do the work.


`Finite` verbs are distinguished from `non-finite` verbs such as:

* infinitives
* participles

which generally mark these grammatical categories to a lesser degree or not at all, and which appear below the finite verb in the hierarchy of syntactic structure.


### Forms of the subject

The **subject** is a `constituent` that can be *realized in numerous forms* in English and other languages, many of which are listed in the following table:

Form of subject

`Noun (phrase)` or `pronoun` **The large car** stopped outside our house.
A `gerund` (phrase)	**His constant hammering** was annoying.
A `to-infinitive` (phrase)	**To read** is easier than to write.
A `full *that*-clause`	**That he had traveled the world** was known to everyone.
A `free relative` clause	**Whatever he did** was always of interest.
A `direct quotation`	**I love you** is often heard these days.
`Zero (but implied) subject`	Take out the trash!
An `expletive`	**It** is raining.
A cataphoric `it`	**It** was known by everyone that he had traveled the world.

### Three criteria for identifying subjects in English

Three criteria for identifying subjects in English and other languages are listed next:

1. Subject-verb agreement: ~{the-subject} agrees with the **finite verb** in person and number, e.g. ~{I} ~(to-be) >> I am vs. *I is*. Or we is. Ten chip vs Ten chips. (Say its a name, than it becomes hard to identify, if We is the name of a person: "We is not following through on our plan!" it is still the subject, but the verb to-be is in the wrong form).

1. Position occupied: The *subject* **typically immediately precedes the finite verb in declarative clauses** in English, e.g. ~{Tom} ~(to-laugh).

3. Semantic role: A typical subject in the active voice is an agent or theme, i.e. it performs the action expressed by the verb or when it is a theme, it receives a property assigned to it by the predicate.

Of these three criteria, the first one (agreement) is the most reliable. The subject in English and many other languages agrees with the finite verb in person and number (and sometimes in gender as well). The second and third criterion are merely strong tendencies that can be flouted in certain constructions, e.g.
a. Tom is studying chemistry. - The three criteria agree identifying Tom as the subject.
b. Is Tom studying chemistry? - The 1st and the 3rd criterion identify Tom as the subject.
c. Chemistry is being studied (by Tom). - The 1st and the 2nd criterion identify Chemistry as the subject.
In the first sentence, all three criteria combine to identify Tom as the subject. In the second sentence, which involves the subject-auxiliary inversion of a yes/no-question, the subject immediately follows the finite verb (instead of immediately preceding it), which means the second criterion is flouted. And in the third sentence expressed in the passive voice, the 1st and the 2nd criterion combine to identify chemistry as the subject, whereas the third criterion suggests that by Tom should be the subject because Tom is an agent.


Germanic languages differ with respect to word order in embedded clauses. German and Dutch, for instance, abandon the V2 principle in embedded clauses and replace it with VF (verb final) order, whereas other Germanic languages, e.g. Yiddish and Icelandic, maintain V2 in all clauses, main and embedded.
